If we had direct ownership of the VIEs, we would be able to exercise our rights as a shareholder to effect changes in the board of directors of these entities, which in turn could effect changes, subject to any applicable fiduciary obligations, at the management level.

In addition, these individuals may breach, or cause the VIEs to breach, or refuse to renew, the existing contractual agreements. If we cannot resolve any conflict of interest or dispute between us and these individuals, we would have to rely on legal proceedings, which could result in disruption of our business and subject us to substantial uncertainty as to the outcome of any such legal proceedings.

The PRC regulatory authorities could disallow the variable interest entity structure, which would likely result in a material adverse change in our operations, and our ADSs and common shares may decline significantly in value or become worthless.

Our PRC legal counsel has consulted the relevant government authority, which confirmed that, under the currently effective PRC laws and regulations, a company already listed in a foreign stock exchange before promulgation of the latest Cybersecurity Review Measures is not required to go through a cybersecurity review by the Cyberspace Administration of China to conduct a securities offering or maintain its listing status on the foreign stock exchange on which its securities have been listed. Therefore, we believe that under the currently effective PRC laws and regulations, we are not required to go through a cybersecurity review by the Cyberspace Administration of China for conducting a securities offering or maintaining our listing status on the NYSE. In addition, on February&#160;17, 2023, the CSRC promulgated the Circular of the People&#8217;s Republic of China on Administrative Arrangements for Filing of Overseas Offering and Listing of Domestic Enterprises, or the Circular of Overseas Listing and Offering, and the Trial Administrative Measures of the Overseas Securities Offering and Listing by Domestic Companies and five relevant guidelines, or the Overseas Listing Trial Measures. The Overseas Listing Trial Measures became effective on March&#160;31, 2023. Pursuant to the Overseas Listing Trial Measures, PRC domestic companies that seek to offer and list securities in overseas markets, either in direct or indirect means, are required to fulfill the filing procedure with the CSRC and report relevant information. According to the Circular of Overseas Listing and Offering, issuers that have already been listed in an overseas market by March&#160;31, 2023, such as our company, are not required to make any immediate filing. However, under the Overseas Listing Trial Measures, such issuers will be required to complete certain filing procedures with the CSRC in connection with future securities offerings and listings outside of mainland China, including <span style="white-space:nowrap">follow-on</span> offerings, issuance of convertible bonds, offshore relisting after going-private transactions, and other equivalent offering activities. </p>

 <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">However, the PRC government has recently indicated an intent to exert more oversight over offerings that are conducted overseas and/or foreign investment in China-based issuers like us and published a series of rules in this regard, the interpretation and implementation of most of which are subject to changes. Therefore, there are substantial uncertainties as to how PRC governmental authorities will regulate overseas listing in general in the future and whether we are required to complete filing or obtain any specific regulatory approvals from the CSRC, Cyberspace Administration of China or any other PRC governmental authorities for our future offshore offerings. If we had inadvertently concluded that such approvals were not required, or if applicable laws, regulations or interpretations change in a way that requires us to obtain such approval in the future, we may be unable to obtain such necessary approvals in a timely manner, or at all, and such approvals may be rescinded even if obtained. Any such circumstance could subject us to penalties, including fines, suspension of business and revocation of required licenses, significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to continue to offer securities to investors and cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or be worthless.

On December&#160;16, 2021, the PCAOB issued a report to notify the SEC of its determination that the PCAOB was unable to inspect or investigate completely registered public accounting firms headquartered in mainland China and Hong Kong, including our auditor which is headquartered in mainland China. In October 2022, the SEC conclusively listed us as a Commission-Identified Issuer under the HFCAA following the filing of our annual report on Form <span style="white-space:nowrap">20-F</span> for the fiscal year ended May&#160;31, 2022. On December&#160;15, 2022, the PCAOB issued a report that vacated its December&#160;16, 2021 determination and removed mainland China and Hong Kong from the list of jurisdictions where it is unable to inspect or investigate completely registered public accounting firms. As of the date of this annual report, the PCAOB has not issued any new determination that it is unable to inspect or investigate completely registered public accounting firms headquartered in any jurisdiction. For this reason, we do not expect to be identified as a Commission-Identified Issuer under the HFCAA after we file this annual report on Form <span style="white-space:nowrap">20-F.</span> Each year, the PCAOB will determine whether it can inspect and investigate completely audit firms in mainland China and Hong Kong, among other jurisdictions. If the PCAOB determines in the future that it no longer has full access to inspect and investigate completely accounting firms in mainland China and Hong Kong and we continue to use an accounting firm headquartered in one of these jurisdictions to issue an audit report on our financial statements filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, we would be identified as a Commission-Identified Issuer following the filing of the annual report on Form <span style="white-space:nowrap">20-F</span> for the relevant fiscal year. There can be no assurance that we would not be identified as a Commission-Identified Issuer for any future fiscal year, and if we were so identified for two consecutive years, we would become subject to the prohibition on trading under the HFCAA. See &#8220;Item 3. Key Information&#8212;D. Risk Factors&#8212;Risk Factors Related to Doing Business in China&#8212;The PCAOB had historically been unable to inspect our auditor in relation to their audit work performed for our financial statements and the inability of the PCAOB to conduct inspections of our auditor in the past has deprived our investors with the benefits of such inspections&#8221; and &#8220;&#8212;Our ADSs may be prohibited from trading in the United States under the HFCAA in the future if the PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate completely auditors located in China. The delisting of the ADSs, or the threat of their being delisted, may materially and adversely affect the value of your investment.&#8221; </p>

Although currently there are not equivalent or similar restrictions or limitations in Hong Kong on cash transfers in, or out of, our Hong Kong entities, if certain restrictions or limitations in China were to become applicable to cash transfers in and out of Hong Kong entities in the future, the funds in our Hong Kong entities, likewise, may not be available to fund operations or for other use outside of Hong Kong. For risks relating to the fund flows of our operations in China, see &#8220;Item 3. Key Information&#8212;D. Risk Factors&#8212;Risks Related to Our Corporate Structure&#8212;We may rely on dividends and other distributions on equity paid by our wholly-owned subsidiaries to fund any cash and financing requirements we may have, and any limitation on the ability of our subsidiaries or New Oriental China and its schools and subsidiaries to make payments to us could have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business&#8221; and &#8220;Item 3.

For the fiscal years ended May&#160;31, 2023, 2024 and 2025, New Oriental Education&#160;&amp; Technology Group Inc. received repayment of loans of US$290.0&#160;million, US$1.5&#160;million and US$128.4&#160;million from our intermediate holding companies and subsidiaries, respectively.

Our board of directors will reevaluate this plan upon its expiration. For the fiscal year 2026, our board of directors will determine the implementation of this plan based on the net income attributable to New Oriental for the fiscal year ended May&#160;31, 2025 in due course. Our board of directors reserves discretion to determine the form, timing and amount of shareholder return measures in any fiscal year based on our results of operations, capital requirements and other relevant factors.

Any failure to effectively and efficiently manage changes of our business may materially and adversely affect our ability to capitalize on new business opportunities, which in turn may have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. </span></p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:bold"><span style="font-style:italic">If we fail to successfully execute our business strategies, our business and prospects may be materially and adversely affected. </span></p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Following the cessation of the <span style="white-space:nowrap">K-9</span> Academic AST Services since the end of 2021, we have shifted our business focus to expand our remaining program, service and product offerings, update and expand the content of our programs, services and products in a cost-effective and timely manner, investing in new business initiatives, as well as maintain and continue to establish strategic relationships with complementary businesses. The expansion of our programs, services and products in terms of types of offerings and the launch of new business initiatives may not succeed due to competition, failure to effectively market our new programs, services and products and maintain their quality and consistency, or other factors. In addition, we may be unable to identify new cities with sufficient growth potential to expand our network, and we may fail to attract students and increase student enrollments or recruit, train and retain qualified teachers or staff for our new programs or product and service offerings.

In particular, our compliance with the Opinions on Further Alleviating the Burden of Homework and After-School Tutoring for Students in Compulsory Education and the implementation measures issued thereunder by the relevant PRC government authorities has had, and could have further, material adverse effect on us. </span></p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The PRC private education industry, especially the after-school tutoring sector, has experienced intense scrutiny and has been subject to significant regulatory changes. In particular, the Opinions on Further Alleviating the Burden of Homework and After-School Tutoring for Students in Compulsory Education jointly promulgated by the General Office of State Council and the General Office of Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on July&#160;24, 2021, or the Alleviating Burden Opinion, sets out a series of operating requirements on after-school tutoring institutions, including, among other things, (i)&#160;local government authorities shall no longer approve any new after-school tutoring institutions providing tutoring services on academic subjects for students in compulsory education, or the Academic AST Institutions, and all the existing Academic AST Institutions shall be registered as <span style="white-space:nowrap">non-profit,</span> and local government authorities shall no longer approve any new after-school tutoring institutions providing tutoring services on academic subjects for <span style="white-space:nowrap"><span style="white-space:nowrap">pre-school-age</span></span> children and students in grade ten to twelve; (ii)&#160;online Academic AST Institutions that have filed with the local education administration authorities will be subject to review and <span style="white-space:nowrap">re-approval</span> procedures by competent government authorities, and any failure to obtain such approval will result in the cancellation of its previous filing and ICP license; (iii)&#160;Academic AST Institutions are prohibited from raising funds by listing on stock markets or conducting any capitalization activities and listed companies are prohibited from investing in Academic AST Institutions through capital markets fund raising activities, or acquiring assets of Academic AST Institutions by paying cash or issuing securities; (iv)&#160;foreign capital is prohibited from controlling or participating in any Academic AST Institutions through mergers and acquisitions, entrusted operation, joining franchise or variable interest entities; (v)&#160;for <span style="white-space:nowrap">non-academic</span> tutoring, local authorities shall identify corresponding competent authorities for different tutoring categories, set forth standards and approve relevant <span style="white-space:nowrap">non-academic</span> tutoring institutions; and (vi)&#160;other compliance requirements for the operation of after-school tutoring institutions, including without limitation that after-school tutoring institutions shall not provide tutoring services during national holidays, weekends and winter and summer breaks, and requirements on risk management and control over the <span style="white-space:nowrap">pre-collection</span> of fees by after-school tutoring institutions. The Alleviating Burden Opinion further provides that administration and supervision over academic subjects tutoring institutions for students in grade ten to twelve shall be implemented by reference to the relevant provisions of the Alleviating Burden Opinion. Moreover, on February&#160;8, 2022, the Chinese Ministry of Education issued its key tasks for 2022 on its website, which specifies that administration over academic subjects tutoring for students in grade ten to twelve shall be strictly implemented by reference to the relevant provisions regarding administration over academic subjects tutoring for students in compulsory education. It remains uncertain as to how and to what extent the administration over academic subjects tutoring institutions for students in grade ten to twelve will be implemented by reference of the Alleviating Burden Opinion. Therefore, we cannot assure you that we would not be required to take further actions regarding our academic tutoring services for students in grade ten to twelve to comply with the Alleviating Burden Opinion and its implementation measures, and there can be no assurance that we could fully comply with any further or detailed requirements regarding our academic tutoring services for students in grade ten to twelve in a timely manner, or at all. Any failure to comply with such requirements could subject us to fines, other penalties, refund to students and negative publicity, and in the worst case scenario, we may have to cease our academic tutoring services for students in grade ten to twelve, which could materially and adversely affect our business operation, financial condition and results of operations.

 <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">To implement the Alleviating Burden Opinion, on September&#160;7, 2021, the Chinese Ministry of Education published on its official website that the Chinese Ministry of Education, together with two other government authorities, issued a circular requiring all Academic AST Institutions to complete registration as <span style="white-space:nowrap">non-profit</span> by the end of 2021, and all Academic AST Institutions shall, before completing such registration, suspend enrollment of students and charging fees. Moreover, in 2022, the Chinese Ministry of Education and other authorities further issued notices and opinions on regulating <span style="white-space:nowrap">non-academic</span> after school training institutions. In addition, in August 2023, the Chinese Ministry of Education issued the Interim Measures for Administrative Penalties on <span style="white-space:nowrap">Off-campus</span> Tutoring, which became effective on October&#160;15, 2023 and set out the general requirements for administrative penalties for illegal <span style="white-space:nowrap">off-campus</span> tutoring operated by any natural person, legal person or other organization that is offered to preschool children over 3 years of age, and primary and secondary school students. On February&#160;8, 2024, the Chinese Ministry of Education issued the Administrative Regulations on <span style="white-space:nowrap">Off-campus</span> Tutoring (Draft for Comments). As of the date of this annual report, the draft regulations had not come into effect. As these regulations and rules on implementing the Alleviating Burden Opinion are evolving and uncertain, their interpretation and implementation are subject to changes, we cannot assure you that we would not be required to take further actions regarding our tutoring services to comply with these regulations and rules, and there can be no assurance that we could fully comply with any further or detailed requirements regarding our tutoring services in a timely manner, or at all. Any failure to comply with such requirements could subject us to fines, other penalties, refund to students and negative publicity, and in the worst case scenario, we may have to cease our relevant tutoring services, which could materially and adversely affect our business operation, financial condition and results of operations. See &#8220;Item 4. Information on the Company&#8212;B.

We have been closely monitoring the evolving regulatory environment and are making efforts to seek guidance from and cooperate with the government authorities to comply with the Alleviating Burden Opinion and its implementation measures. Among other things, we ceased <span style="white-space:nowrap">K-9</span> Academic AST Services in all of our schools and learning centers in China at the end of 2021, including closing of some of our schools and learning centers and implementing employee layoffs where necessary to maintain our continued operations. We incurred considerable costs and expenses for the fiscal year ended May&#160;31, 2022 resulting from termination of leases, dismissal of employees and other actions we took in light of the regulatory developments. Due to the complex and evolving regulatory environment, we cannot assure you that our operations would be in full compliance with applicable laws, regulations, policies and requirements imposed by local governmental authorities, including the Alleviating Burden Opinion and its implementation measures, in a timely manner, or at all. We may become subject to fines or other penalties or be required to terminate certain operations, and negative publicity, investigations by governmental authorities, refund to students, revocation of certain permits and negative influence on our ongoing permit applications, each occurrence of which may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are continually making efforts to comply with the requirements under these regulations and implementations. However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to comply with such requirements in a timely manner, or at all. For example, although we believe the provision of digital educational resources through our intelligent learning systems and devices shall not be considered as after-school tutoring activities, and we have not received any notice from the competent government authorities indicating that such activities are deemed as after-school tutoring activities, we cannot assure you that the competent government authorities will not take a contrary view to ours. In the event that the provision of digital academic educational resources through our intelligent learning systems and devices is deemed as after-school tutoring activities, the academic educational resources provided by our intelligent learning systems and devices to <span style="white-space:nowrap">K-9</span> students shall comply with all regulations related to academic after-school tutoring, including, among others, the Alleviating Burden Opinion. Our PRC operating entities of the intelligent learning systems and devices may then be deemed as Academic AST Institutions, and these entities will be prohibited from being controlled by us as the Alleviating Burden Opinion prohibits foreign ownership in Academic AST Institutions, including through contractual arrangements. If we fail to comply with these requirements and any other applicable regulatory requirements, we may be subject to fines, regulatory orders to suspend our operations and other regulatory and disciplinary sanctions, or even orders to relinquish our contractual arrangements, all of which may materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. Moreover, we cannot assure you that there will not be any new rules or regulations in China on the business we currently operate, or such new rules and regulations will not subject our business operations to further adjustments and in the event of such changes, our business operations may be adversely impacted. </p>

Therefore, our ability to attract students to enroll in our courses without a significant decrease in course fees is critical to the continued success and growth of our business. This in turn will depend on several factors, including our ability to develop new programs and enhance existing programs to respond to regulatory developments, changes in market trends and student demands, maintain the consistency of our teaching quality, effectively market our programs to a broader base of prospective students, develop and license additional high-quality educational content and respond to competitive pressures. If we are unable to attract students to enroll in our courses without a significant decrease in course fees, our revenue may decline and we may not be able to maintain profitability. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:bold"><span style="font-style:italic">Our business depends on our &#8220;New Oriental&#8221; brand, and if we are not able to maintain and enhance our brand, our business and operating results may be harmed. </span></p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We believe that market awareness of our &#8220;New Oriental&#8221; brand has contributed significantly to the success of our business. We also believe that maintaining and enhancing the &#8220;New Oriental&#8221; brand is critical to maintaining our competitive advantage. We offer a diverse set of programs, services and products to student populations of all ages across China. Our future business strategy to develop new program, service and product offerings and extend our reach to new areas may make it more difficult to maintain quality and consistency. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have mainly relied on <span style="white-space:nowrap"><span style="white-space:nowrap">word-of-mouth</span></span> referrals to attract prospective students. We also use various marketing and promotion activities, such as online demo courses, social media promotions and outdoor advertising campaigns to promote our brand and course offerings. We cannot, however, assure you that these or our other marketing efforts will be successful in promoting our brand to remain competitive. If we are unable to further enhance our brand recognition and increase awareness of our programs, services and products, or if we incur excessive marketing and promotion expenses, our business and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. In addition, any negative publicity relating to our company or our programs and services, regardless of its veracity, could harm our brand image and in turn materially and adversely affect our business and operating results. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:bold"><span style="font-style:italic">We depend on our dedicated and capable faculty and staff, and if we are not able to maintain consistent teaching quality throughout our school network, or service quality throughout our brand, business and operating results may be materially and adversely affected. </span></p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our teachers and staff are critical to maintaining the quality of our programs, services and products and maintaining our brand and reputation. It is critical for us to continue to attract qualified teachers who have a strong command of the subject areas to be taught and meet our qualification and staff who have strong professional capabilities. We also need to hire teachers and staff who are capable of delivering innovative and inspirational instruction or premium services. We must also provide continuous training to our teachers and staff so that they can stay up to date with changes in student demands, admissions and assessment tests, admissions standards, and other key trends necessary to effectively teach their respective courses or provide their services. We may not be able to hire, train and retain enough qualified teachers or staff to keep pace with our anticipated development while maintaining consistent teaching quality across our education services or service quality across our other services. In addition, PRC laws and regulations require our teachers and staff to have requisite licenses if they teach, among others, academic subject such as Chinese, mathematics, English, physics, chemistry, biography, history, geography, and teachers are also required to have relevant qualifications if they teach <span style="white-space:nowrap">non-academic</span> subjects. However, we cannot assure you that our teachers can all apply for and obtain the teaching licenses and relevant qualifications in a timely manner or at all due to various reasons, such as the time gap between the recruitment and the newly-recruited teachers taking the exam and ultimately obtaining the teacher license or relevant qualifications, and the cancellation and delay of teacher license examinations and other qualifications examinations. If some of our teachers, due to various reasons, are unable to apply for and obtain the requisite teaching licenses on a timely basis, or at all, we may be required to rectify such <span style="white-space:nowrap">non-compliance</span> and may not be able to continue to retain such teachers. Shortages of qualified teachers and/or staff or decreases in the quality of our instruction or service, whether actual or perceived, in one or more of our markets may have a material and adverse effect on our business. </p>

These types of claims have been brought, sometimes successfully, against print publications and educational institutions in the past, including ourselves. For example, in January 2001, the Graduate Management Admission Council, or GMAC, and Educational Testing Service, or ETS, filed three separate lawsuits against us in the Beijing No.&#160;1 Intermediate People&#8217;s Court, alleging that we had violated the copyrights and trademarks relating to the GMAT test owned by GMAC and relating to the GRE and TOEFL tests owned by ETS by duplicating, selling and distributing their test materials without their authorization. In September 2003, the trial court found that we had violated GMAC&#8217;s and ETS&#8217; respective copyrights and trademarks in connection with those admissions tests. The trial court&#8217;s judgment was partially affirmed in a final judgment issued by the Beijing Higher People&#8217;s Court in December 2004. The Beijing Higher People&#8217;s Court held that we had not misused the trademarks of GMAC or ETS. However, it also found that the TOEFL and GRE tests were the original works of ETS and the GMAT test was the original work of GMAC, all of which are protected under the PRC Copyright Law. The Beijing Higher People&#8217;s Court held that our duplication, sale and distribution of the test materials relating to these tests without ETS&#8217; and GMAC&#8217;s prior permission were not a &#8220;reasonable use&#8221; of the test materials under the PRC Copyright Law, and that we, therefore, had infringed upon ETS&#8217; and GMAC&#8217;s respective copyrights. We were ordered to pay damages in an aggregate of approximately RMB6.5&#160;million, cease all infringing activities and destroy all copyright-infringing materials in our possession, all of which we have done. Since the Beijing Higher People&#8217;s Court issued the final judgment in 2004, we have endeavored to comply with the court order and applicable PRC laws and regulations relating to intellectual property, and we have adopted policies and procedures to prohibit our employees and contractors from engaging in any copyright, trademark or trade name infringing activities. However, we cannot assure you that every teacher or other personnel will strictly comply with these policies at our schools, learning centers or other locations or media through which we provide our programs, services and products. </p>

 <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In order to develop, improve, promote and deliver new products and services, we cooperate with various leading international education content providers and are required to obtain licenses from others from time to time. For example, we have worked with Cambridge University Press, Oxford University Press, Educational Testing Service, Cengage Learning and other education content providers in distributing their education material in China. With access to such high-quality education content, we further develop localized products that best serve the needs for millions of students and families in the China market. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to obtain licenses on commercially reasonable terms or at all or that rights granted under any licenses will be valid and enforceable. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have been involved in other claims and legal proceedings against us relating to infringement of third parties&#8217; copyrights in materials distributed by us and the unauthorized use of a third party&#8217;s name in connection with the marketing and promotion of our programs, and may be subject to further claims in the future, particularly in light of the potential changes in the interpretation and application of intellectual property laws and regulations. Furthermore, if printed publications or other materials that we or our teachers author and/or distribute contain materials that government authorities find objectionable, these publications may have to be recalled, which could result in increased expenses, loss in revenues and adverse publicity. Any claims against us, with or without merit, could be time-consuming and costly to defend or litigate, divert our management&#8217;s attention and resources or result in the loss of goodwill associated with our brand. If a lawsuit against us is successful, we may be required to pay substantial damages and/or enter into royalty or license agreements that may not be based upon commercially reasonable terms, or we may be unable to enter into such agreements at all. We may also lose, or be limited in, the rights to offer some of our programs, services and products or be required to make changes to our course materials or websites. As a result, the scope of our course materials could be reduced, which could adversely affect the effectiveness of our teaching, limit our ability to attract new students, harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:bold"><span style="font-style:italic">We may lose our competitive advantage and our reputation, brand and operations may suffer if we fail to prevent the loss or misappropriation of or disputes over, our intellectual property rights. </span></p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We consider our trademarks and trade name invaluable to our ability to continue to develop and enhance our brand recognition. We have spent over 20 years building our &#8220;New Oriental&#8221; brand by emphasizing quality and consistency and building trust among students and parents. From time to time, our trademarks and trade name have been used by third parties for or as part of other branded programs, services and products unrelated to us. We have sent cease and desist letters to such third parties in the past and will continue to do so in the future. However, preventing trademark and trade name infringement is difficult, costly and time-consuming and continued unauthorized use of our trademarks and trade name by unrelated third parties may damage our reputation and brand. In addition, we have spent significant time and expense developing or licensing and localizing the content of our educational materials to enrich our product offerings and meet students&#8217; needs. There can be no assurance that competitors will not independently develop similar intellectual property. If others are able to copy and use our programs and services, we may not be able to maintain our competitive position. The measures we take to protect our trademarks, copyrights and other intellectual property rights, which presently are based upon a combination of trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, may not be adequate to prevent unauthorized use by third parties. Furthermore, the application of laws governing intellectual property rights in China and abroad is uncertain and evolving, and could involve substantial risks to us. If we are unable to adequately protect our trademarks, copyrights and other intellectual property rights, we may lose these rights, our brand name may be harmed, and our business may suffer materially. </p>

We face competition in each major program we offer and each geographic market in which we operate. For example, we face competition from companies that focus on test preparation services in China. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our student enrollments may decrease due to intense competition. Some of our competitors may have more resources and experiences than we do. These competitors may be able to devote greater resources than we can to the development, promotion and sale of their programs, services and products and respond more quickly than we can to changes in student needs, testing materials, admissions standards, or new technologies. In addition, we face competition from many different smaller sized organizations that focus on some of our targeted markets, and they may be able to respond more promptly to changes in student preferences in these markets. We also face competition from online educational service providers that offer online test preparation. These online education service providers use advanced technologies such as online live broadcasting technologies, to offer their programs, services and products quickly and cost-effectively to a large number of students. We may have to reduce course fees or increase spending in response to competition in order to retain or attract students or pursue new market opportunities, which could result in a decrease of our revenues and profitability. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We also face intense competition from other livestreaming <span style="white-space:nowrap">e-commerce</span> players. Some of our competitors may have longer operating histories and greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do or have an advantage in attracting and retaining consumers and business partners. In addition, our competitors may have larger consumer bases or more established brand names than we do and therefore would be able to more effectively leverage their consumer bases and brand names to conduct livestreaming activities and operate <span style="white-space:nowrap">e-commerce</span> business. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully and grow our business.

For example, we were required to close our learning centers in certain regions from time to time where new cases of <span style="white-space:nowrap">COVID-19</span> were discovered between the end of 2020 and 2022. Any future outbreak of adverse public health developments in China may have a material and adverse effect on our business operations. These occurrences could cause cancelations or deferments of student enrollments and require the temporary closure of our schools, learning centers and bookstores while we remain obligated to pay rent and other expenses for these facilities, thus severely disrupting our business operations and materially and adversely affecting our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:bold"><span style="font-style:italic">We had experienced and may experience a decrease in our margins. </span></p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Many factors may cause our gross and net margins to decline. The regulatory developments regarding Academic AST Institutions&#8217; after-school tutoring business had caused a decline in our gross and net margin. Our operating margin turned positive for the fiscal year ended May&#160;31, 2023 and continued to improve for the fiscal years ended May&#160;31, 2024 and 2025. However, there is no assurance that we will be able to maintain or improve our operating margin in the future. In addition, new businesses may not have the same margins as we had in the past, and new investments and acquisitions may cause our margins to decline before we successfully integrate the acquired businesses into our operations and realize the full benefits of these investments and acquisitions. It is possible that our margins could decline in the future due to these factors. </p>

While some of the programs, services and products that we develop will expand our current offerings and increase student enrollments, others may compete with or render obsolete our existing offerings without increasing our total student enrollments. For example, our online courses may attract students away from our existing classroom-based courses. If we are unable to expand our program, service and product offerings while increasing our total student enrollments and profitability, our business and growth may be adversely affected. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:bold"><span style="font-style:italic">Our business is subject to fluctuations caused by seasonality or other factors beyond our control, which may cause our operating results to fluctuate from quarter to quarter. This may result in volatility and adversely affect the price of our common shares and ADSs. </span></p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, seasonal fluctuations in our revenues and results of operations, primarily due to seasonal changes in student enrollments in educational business and some other services. Our test preparation courses tend to have the highest revenue in our first fiscal quarter, which runs from June&#160;1 to August&#160;31 of each year, primarily because a significant number of students enroll in our courses during summer vacation to prepare for admissions and assessment tests. However, our expenses vary, and certain of our expenses do not necessarily correspond with changes in our student enrollments and revenues. For example, we make investments in marketing and promotion, teacher recruitment and training, and product development throughout the year and we pay rent for our facilities based on the terms of the lease agreements. In addition, other factors beyond our control, including health epidemics and special events that take place during a quarter when our student enrollment would normally be high, may have a negative impact on our student enrollments. We expect quarterly fluctuations in our revenues and results of operations to continue. These fluctuations could result in volatility and adversely affect the price of our common shares and ADSs. As our revenues grow, these seasonal fluctuations may become more pronounced. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:bold"><span style="font-style:italic">Our reputation, results of operations, financial condition and the trading price of our ADSs and common shares may be negatively affected by adverse publicity or other detrimental conduct against us. </span></p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Adverse publicity concerning our failure or perceived failure to comply with legal and regulatory requirements, alleged accounting or financial reporting irregularities, regulatory scrutiny and further regulatory action or litigation could harm our reputation, result in our incurrence of substantial costs and distract our management&#8217;s attention and cause the trading price of our ADSs and common shares to decline and fluctuate significantly. For example, on July&#160;24, 2021, China&#8217;s official state media, including Xinhua News Agency and China Central Television, announced the Alleviating Burden Opinion, issued by the General Office of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the General Office of the State Council. The Alleviating Burden Opinion contains high-level directives about requirements and restrictions related to after-school tutoring services. The trading price of our ADSs and common shares declined sharply before and after the Alleviating Burden Opinion was issued. After we announced the departure of Mr.&#160;Yuhui Dong, a popular livestreamer, and sale of Time with Yuhui (Beijing) Technology Ltd to Mr.&#160;Dong on July&#160;25, 2024, the trading price of our ADSs and common shares declined sharply and we were inundated by numerous investor inquiries. In addition, certain of our directors are subject to class actions due to their current or previous directorships in other listed companies. Our directors and executive officers may also face litigation or proceedings (including alleged or future securities class action) unrelated to their respective capacity as a director or executive officer of our company, and such litigation or proceedings may adversely affect our public image and reputation. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We may continue to be the target of adverse publicity and other detrimental conduct against us. Such conduct includes complaints, anonymous or otherwise, to regulatory agencies regarding our operations, accounting, revenues and regulatory compliance. Additionally, allegations against us may be posted on the internet by any person or entity which identifies itself or on an anonymous basis. We may be subject to government or regulatory investigation or inquiries as a result of such third-party conduct and may be required to incur significant time and substantial costs to defend ourselves, and there is no assurance that we will be able to conclusively refute each of the allegations within a reasonable period of time, or at all. Our reputation may also be negatively affected as a result of the public dissemination of allegations or malicious statements about us, which in turn may materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition and the trading price of our ADSs and common shares. </p>

These changes require us to continually update and enhance our course materials and our teaching methods. In December 2017, the Chinese Ministry of Education issued the 2017 Curriculum Schemes and Curriculum Standards for Senior Secondary Schools, which was furthered amended in May 2020, and further issued the Opinions on the Implementing Work of the New Curriculums and the New Textbooks of Senior Secondary Schools in August 2018, both of which provide that the Chinese Ministry of Education developed a new nationwide senior secondary school curriculum system and organized the compilation of a group of new textbooks based on the new curriculum system, which shall be adopted in certain provinces from September 2019 and gradually expand to all other provinces by September 2022. On August&#160;25, 2021, the General Office of Chinese Ministry of Education issued the Administrative Measures for After-School Tutoring Materials for Primary and Secondary School Students (for Trial Implementation). See &#8220;Item 4. Information on the Company&#8212;B. Business Overview&#8212;Regulation&#8212;Regulations on Private Education&#8212;Regulations on After-School Tutoring.&#8221; </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We adapt our tutoring programs and materials to new curriculum and tutoring material requirements promulgated from time to time. However, there can be no assurance that we are able to or we will comply with all such requirements, and any inability to comply with any of the requirements in a timely manner, or at all, may subject us to rectification measures, suspension of using tutoring materials or even revocation of our private school operation permit, which may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, any inability to track and respond to these changes in a timely and cost-effective manner would make our programs, services and products less attractive to students, which may materially and adversely affect our reputation and ability to continue to attract students without a significant decrease in course fees. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:bold"><span style="font-style:italic">If colleges, universities and other higher education institutions reduce their reliance on admissions and assessment tests, we may experience a decrease in demand for our services and products and our business may be materially and adversely affected. </span></p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The use of admissions tests in China may decline or fall out of favor with educational institutions and government authorities. For example, educational institutions and government authorities in China have had discussions and conducted early experiments in China on school admissions. Generally, these discussions and experiments exhibit a trend of admission decisions based less on entrance exam scores and more on a combination of other factors, such as past academic record, extracurricular activities and comprehensive aptitude evaluations. If we fail to respond to these changes, the demand for certain of our services may decline, and our business may be materially and adversely affected. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In the United States, there has been a continuing debate regarding the usefulness of admissions and assessment tests to assess qualifications of applicants and many people have criticized the use of admissions and assessment tests as unfairly discriminating against certain test takers. If a large number of educational institutions abandon the use of existing admissions and assessment tests as a requirement for admission, without replacing them with other admissions and assessment tests, we may experience a decrease in demand for our overseas test preparation courses and our business may be adversely affected. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:bold"><span style="font-style:italic">We might not be able to fulfil our obligation in respect of deferred revenue, which might have impact on our cash/liquidity position. </span></p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our recognition of deferred revenue is subject to future performance obligations and may not be representative of revenues for future periods. Tuition for our educational programs and services is generally collected in advance and is initially recorded as deferred revenue, which will be recognized when the services are delivered. Due to potential future changes in customer preferences and future changes in regulations and the need for us to satisfactorily perform product support and other services, deferred revenue at any particular date may not be representative of actual revenue for any current or future period. Any failure to fulfil the obligations in respect of deferred revenue may have an adverse impact on our results of operations and liquidity. </p>

For example, we recorded a loss from fair value change of long-term investments in the fiscal year ended May&#160;31, 2023 of US$0.9&#160;million. We recorded a gain from fair value change of long-term investments in the fiscal year ended May&#160;31, 2024 of US$19.0&#160;million and a loss from fair value change of long-term investments in the fiscal year ended May&#160;31, 2025 of US$10.1&#160;million. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We may use significant unobservable inputs, such as investee&#8217;s historical earning, discount of lack of marketability, investee&#8217;s time to initial public offering as well as related volatility in valuing our long-term investments. The assumptions are inherently uncertain and subjective, requiring us to make significant estimates, which may be subject to material changes, and therefore inherently involves a certain degree of uncertainty.

We have expanded our offerings through internal development and external investments. Some of these operations have not generated significant or any profit to date, and we have less experience responding quickly to changes, competing successfully and maintaining and expanding our brand in these areas without jeopardizing our brand in other areas. For instance, in fiscal year 2022, East Buy (formerly known as Koolearn) established an <span style="white-space:nowrap">e-commerce</span> platform under the brand name East Buy (<span style="font-family:pmingliu; font-size:9pt">&#19996;&#26041;&#29956;&#36873;</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:10pt">) for the sale of agricultural and other products through livestreaming activities. East Buy has made notable progress in its sale of private label products and livestreaming <span style="white-space:nowrap">e-commerce</span> business in fiscal years 2023, 2024 and 2025. We cannot assure you that the livestreaming events through East Buy will continue to be popular and generate increasing net income as we expect. Consequently, there is limited operating history on which you can base your evaluation of the business and prospects of these relatively more recent operations. </span></p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:bold"><span style="font-style:italic">The continuing efforts of our senior management team and other key personnel are important to our success, and our business may be harmed if we lose their services. </span></p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">It is important for us to have the continuing services of our senior management team, in particular, Mr.&#160;Michael Minhong Yu, our founder and executive chairman, who has been our leader since our inception in 1993. If one or more of our senior executives or other key personnel are unable or unwilling to continue in their present positions, we may not be able to replace them easily, and our business may be disrupted. Competition for experienced management personnel in the private education sector and influential livestreaming hosts in our livestreaming <span style="white-space:nowrap">e-commerce</span> business is intense, the pool of qualified candidates is very limited, and we may not be able to retain the services of our senior executives or key personnel, or attract and retain high-quality senior executives or key personnel in the future. In addition, if any member of our senior management team or any of our other key personnel joins a competitor or forms a competing company, we may lose teachers, students, key professionals and staff members. Each of our executive officers and key employees is subject to the duty of confidentiality and <span style="white-space:nowrap">non-competition</span> restrictions. However, if any disputes arise between any of our senior executives or key personnel and us, it may be difficult to successfully pursue legal actions against these individuals. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:bold"><span style="font-style:italic">We rely on livestreamers to host livestreaming sessions.

The success of our livestreaming <span style="white-space:nowrap">e-commerce</span> business is influenced by the popularity of the livestreamers. Popular livestreamers are able to reach a wider audience when they promote the products and direct more potential consumers to purchase such products. In particular, since their inception in January 2024, the livestreaming accounts operated under the brand name &#8220;Time with Yuhui,&#8221; a brand name associated with Mr.&#160;Yuhui Dong, a popular livestreamer, have gained great popularity and attracted a wide range of consumers. In July 2024, Beijing Xuncheng, Mr.&#160;Yuhui Dong, and Time with Yuhui (Beijing) Technology Ltd, or Time with Yuhui, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Beijing Xuncheng that primarily engages in businesses under the brand &#8220;Time with Yuhui,&#8221; entered into an agreement under which Beijing Xuncheng agreed to sell, and Mr.&#160;Yuhui Dong agreed to acquire, 100% of the equity of Time with Yuhui. In August 2024, Time with Yuhui ceased to be a consolidated affiliated entity of East Buy and the financial results of Time with Yuhui has no longer been consolidated into the consolidated financial statements of East Buy. </p>

We must quickly modify our programs, services and products to adapt to changing student needs and preferences, technological advances and evolving internet practices to compete successfully in the online education market. Ongoing enhancement of our online offerings and related technology may entail significant expense and technical risk. We may fail to use new technologies effectively or adapt our online products or services and related technology on a timely and cost-effective basis. In addition, we developed our OMO standardized digital classroom teaching system in 2014, which has since evolved into an online education system that complements and supports students&#8217; offline learning activities. OMO stands for online-merge-offline, which means the integration of our offline network of schools and learning centers and online education system to facilitate our operational efficiency. We have applied the OMO system across our comprehensive educational service offerings. If our improvements to our online offerings and online education systems and the related technology are delayed, result in systems interruptions or are not aligned with market expectations or preferences, we may lose market share and our business could be adversely affected. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:bold"><span style="font-style:italic">Failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section&#160;404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 could have a material and adverse effect on the trading price of our common shares and ADSs. </span></p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are subject to the reporting obligations under the U.S. securities laws.

In addition, an independent registered public accounting firm must attest to and report on the effectiveness of the company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting. Although our management concluded, and our independent registered public accounting firm reported, that we maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of May&#160;31, 2025, we cannot assure you that we will maintain effective internal control over financial reporting on an ongoing basis. If we fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, we will not be able to conclude and our independent registered public accounting firm will not be able to report that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 in our future annual report on Form <span style="white-space:nowrap">20-F</span> covering the fiscal year in which this failure occurs. Effective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports. Any failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could result in the loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which in turn could have a material and adverse effect on the trading price of our common shares and ADSs. Furthermore, we may need to incur additional costs and use additional management and other resources as our business and operations further expand or in an effort to remediate any significant control deficiencies that may be identified in the future. </p>

Although we use elastic cloud computing with an aim to timely expand our online program infrastructure to meet demand for such programs, we cannot assure you this will be sufficient to meet the increasing demands of our students as our business continues to grow. Our computer systems and operations could be vulnerable to interruption or malfunction due to events beyond our control, including natural disasters and telecommunications failures.

However, our computer networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, hacking, computer viruses and other security problems.

A user who circumvents security measures could misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions or malfunctions in operations. We could suffer economic and reputational damages and even bear legal liabilities if a technical failure of our systems or a security breach compromises student data, including identification or contact information, although there has not been any material compromise in the past.

The PRC Data Security Law, among other things, provides for security review procedure for data-related activities that may affect national security. On December&#160;28, 2021, the Cyberspace Administration of China, together with other authorities, jointly promulgated the Cybersecurity Review Measures, which became effective on February&#160;15, 2022 and replaced its predecessor regulation. Pursuant to the Cybersecurity Review Measures, critical information infrastructure operators that procure internet products and services and network platform operators engaging in data processing activities must be subject to the cybersecurity review if their activities affect or may affect national security. The Cybersecurity Review Measures further stipulates that network platform operators that hold personal information of over one million users shall apply with the Cybersecurity Review Office for a cybersecurity review before any public offering at a foreign stock exchange. The relevant government authorities may initiate the cybersecurity review against the relevant operators if the authorities believe that the network products or services or data processing activities of such operators affect or may affect national security. Pursuant to the Regulations on the Security Protection of Critical Information Infrastructure promulgated by the State Council on July&#160;30, 2021, which became effective on September&#160;1, 2021, critical information infrastructure shall mean any important network facilities or information systems of the important industry or field such as public communication and information service, energy, communications, water conservation, finance, public services, <span style="white-space:nowrap">e-government</span> affairs and national defense science, which may endanger national security, people&#8217;s livelihood and public interest in case of damage, function loss or data leakage. In addition, relevant administration departments of each critical industry and sector, or Protection Departments, shall be responsible to formulate eligibility criteria and determine the critical information infrastructure operator in the respective industry or sector. The operators shall be informed about the final determination as to whether they are categorized as critical information infrastructure operators. As of the date of this annual report, we have not been informed as a critical information infrastructure operator by any governmental authorities. Furthermore, the exact scope of &#8220;critical information infrastructure operators&#8221; under the current regulatory regime remains unclear, and the PRC government authorities may have wide discretion within their scope of authority in the interpretation and enforcement of the applicable laws. Therefore, it is uncertain whether we would be deemed to be a critical information infrastructure operator under PRC law. If we are deemed to be a critical information infrastructure operator under the PRC cybersecurity laws and regulations, we may be subject to obligations in addition to what we have fulfilled under the PRC cybersecurity laws and regulations. In March 2025, the Cyberspace Administration of China published the Decision of Amending PRC Cybersecurity Law (Second Draft for Comments), or the Second Draft Amendment to PRC Cybersecurity Law, which, among other things, aggravated legal liabilities for violations of cybersecurity obligations and critical information infrastructure operators&#8217; obligations. As of the date of this annual report, the Second Draft Amendment to PRC Cybersecurity Law was released for public comment only, and its respective provisions and anticipated adoption or effective date may be subject to change with substantial uncertainty. As advised by our PRC legal counsel, Tian Yuan Law Firm, as of the date of this annual report, we, our PRC subsidiaries, and the VIEs, are not required to go through a cybersecurity review by Cyberspace Administration of China for our previous issuance of securities to foreign investors. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On August&#160;20, 2021, the Standing Committee of the National People&#8217;s Congress promulgated the Personal Information Protection Law, which took effect on November&#160;1, 2021. The Personal Information Protection Law aims at protecting the personal information rights and interests, regulating the processing of personal information, ensuring the orderly and free flow of personal information in accordance with the law, and promoting the reasonable use of personal information. According to the Personal Information Protection Law, personal information includes all kinds of identified or identifiable information related to natural persons recorded by electronic or other means, but excludes <span style="white-space:nowrap">de-identified</span> information. The Personal Information Protection Law also specified the rules for handling sensitive personal information, which includes biometrics, religious beliefs, specific identities, medical health, financial accounts, trails and locations, and personal information of teenagers under fourteen years old and other personal information, which, upon leakage or illegal usage, may easily infringe the personal dignity or harm of safety of livelihood and property. Personal information handlers shall bear responsibility for their personal information handling activities, and adopt necessary measures to safeguard the security of the personal information they handle. Otherwise, the personal information handlers will be ordered for rectification or suspension or termination of provision of services, confiscation of illegal income, subject to fines or other penalties. </p>

 <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On July&#160;7, 2022, the Cyberspace Administration of China issued the Measures on Security Assessment of the Cross-border Transfer of Data, effective from September&#160;1, 2022. The measures provide that four types of cross-border transfers of critical data or personal data generated from or collected in the PRC should be subject to a security assessment, which include: (i)&#160;a data processor to transfer important data overseas; (ii)&#160;either a critical information infrastructure operator, or a data processor processing personal information of more than 1&#160;million individuals, transfers personal information overseas; (iii)&#160;a data processor who has, since January&#160;1 of the previous year, transferred personal information of more than 100,000 individuals overseas cumulatively, or transferred sensitive personal information of more than 10,000 individuals overseas cumulatively; or (iv)&#160;other circumstances under which security assessment of data cross-border transfer is required as prescribed by the national cyberspace administration. On March&#160;22, 2024, the Cyberspace Administration of China published the Provisions on Promoting and Regulating Cross-border Data Flows, which provide that where the provisions of the Measures on Security Assessment of the Cross-border Transfer of Data conflict with the Provisions on Promoting and Regulating Cross-border Data Flows, the latter shall prevail. According to the foregoing provisions, based on self-evaluation and our communications with relevant government authorities, we believe that currently we are not required to apply for a security assessment for outbound data transfer. However, the interpretation and implementation of these measures and provisions in practice are subject to changes, and we cannot assure you that the competent government authorities will not take a contrary view to ours. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On September&#160;24, 2024, the Administrative Regulations on Internet Data Security were promulgated by the State Council, which came into effect on January&#160;1, 2025. These regulations implement and reiterate the general requirements on data security management from the Cybersecurity Law, the Data Security Law and the Personal Information Protection Law and are aligned with the existing laws and regulations on cybersecurity review, protection of important data and cross-border security management of network data. Network data processors that conduct network data processing activities affecting or potentially affecting national security shall undergo national security review in accordance with relevant state regulations. For data recognized as important data, the relevant regions and departments shall promptly notify the network data processors or publicly release such designation. Notably, if the data has not been notified or publicly released as important data by relevant regions or departments, there is no need to apply for an outbound important data transfer security assessment before transferring the data overseas. On February&#160;12, 2025, the CAC published the Administrative Measures for the Compliance Audit of Personal Information Protection, effective on May&#160;1, 2025. Personal information processors that process personal information of more than ten million individuals shall carry out a compliance audit of personal information protection at least once every two years. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, the AI related regulatory and legal framework is constantly evolving. On December 31, 2021, the CAC, the MIIT, the Ministry of Public Security and the State Administration for Market Regulation joint promulgated the Administrative Provisions on Internet Information Service Algorithm Recommendation, which became effective on March 1, 2022. The Administrative Provisions on Internet Information Service Algorithm Recommendation implement classification and grading management for algorithm recommendation service providers based on various criteria and stipulates that algorithm recommendation service providers with public opinion attributes or social mobilization capabilities shall file with the CAC within ten business days from the date of providing such services. On November 25, 2022, the CAC, the MIIT and the Ministry of Public Security jointly promulgated the Administrative Provisions on Deep Synthesis in Internet-based Information Services, which took effect on January 10, 2023. These provisions require that deep synthesis service providers with public opinion attributes or social mobilization capabilities shall conform with filing requirements, modification procedures or cancelation of filing in accordance with Administrative Provisions on Internet Information Service Algorithm Recommendation. Where deep synthesis service providers develop new products, new applications and new functions with public opinion attributes or social mobilization capabilities, they shall conduct a security assessment in accordance with the relevant provisions. On July 10, 2023, the CAC and six other ministries jointly published the Interim Administrative Measures on Generative AI Service, which came into effect on August 15, 2023. Such measures require service providers offering generative AI services with public opinion attributes or social mobilization capabilities to conduct security assessments and comply with filing formalities, modification procedures and filing cancellation procedures with the CAC in accordance with the Administrative Provisions on Internet Information Service Algorithm Recommendation.

The amount and timing of such additional financing needs will vary principally depending on the timing of new business developments, investments and/or acquisitions, and the amount of cash flow from our operations. If our existing cash resources are insufficient to satisfy our cash requirements, we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain a credit facility. The sale of additional equity securities could result in additional dilution to our shareholders.

If we fail to raise additional funds, we may need to reduce our growth to a level that can be supported by our cash flow. Without additional capital, we may not be able to develop and grow new businesses, acquire necessary technologies, products or businesses, hire, train and retain teachers and other employees, market our programs, services and products, or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated capital requirements. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:bold"><span style="font-style:italic">If we are unable to comply with the restrictions and covenants in connection with our current or future debt and other related agreements, our cash flow and liquidity could be adversely affected. </span></p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We may issue debt securities from time to time. If we are unable to comply with the restrictions and covenants in connection with our current or future debt and other related agreements, there could be a default under the terms of these agreements. In the event of a default under these agreements, the holders of the debt could terminate their commitments to lend to us, accelerate the debt and declare all amounts borrowed due and payable or terminate the agreements, as the case may be. Furthermore, some of our debt agreements may contain cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions. As a result, our default under one debt agreement may cause the acceleration of the debt, or result in a default under our other debt agreements. If any of these events occur, we cannot assure you that our assets and cash flow would be sufficient to repay in full all of our indebtedness, or that we would be able to find alternative financing. Even if we could obtain alternative financing, we cannot assure you that it would be on terms that are favorable or acceptable to us. The occurrence of these events may have a material adverse effect on our cash flow and liquidity. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:bold"><span style="font-style:italic">Failure to control rental costs, obtain leases at desired locations at reasonable prices or protect our leasehold interests could materially and adversely affect our business. </span></p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our office, schools and learning centers are mainly located on leased premises. The lease term generally ranges from two to ten years and the lease agreements are renewable upon mutual consent at the end of the applicable lease period. We may not be able to obtain new leases at desirable locations or renew our existing leases on acceptable terms or at all, which could adversely affect our business. We may have to relocate our operations for various other reasons, including increasing rentals, failure in passing the fire inspection in certain locations, the violation of the prescribed usage of the properties we use, and the early termination of our lease agreements under applicable PRC laws and regulations. For example, in the second and third quarter for the fiscal year ended May&#160;31, 2022, we incurred considerable cost from the termination of our leasing agreements in relation to the closure of our learning centers due to the cessation of our <span style="white-space:nowrap">K-9</span> Academic AST Services. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, a few of our lessors have not been able to provide us with copies of title certificates or other evidentiary documents to prove that they have authorization to lease the properties to us. Our business and legal teams follow an internal procedure to identify and assess risks when leasing properties in the normal course of business, and a final business decision would be made after our analysis of the likely impact of the defects on the leasehold interests and the value of the properties to our expansion plan. However, there is no assurance that our decision would always lead to the favorable outcome we expected to achieve. If any of our leases are terminated as a result of challenges by third parties or government authorities for lack of title certificates or proof of authorization to lease, we do not expect to be subject to any fines or penalties but we may be forced to relocate the affected learning centers and incur additional expenses relating to such relocation. Furthermore, a few of our lessors have mortgaged the properties that we are renting. In the event that these properties are foreclosed on due to the lessors&#8217; failure to perform their obligations to the creditors, we may not be able to continue to use such leased properties and may incur additional expenses for relocation. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, we have not registered some of our lease agreements with the relevant PRC governmental authorities as required by relevant PRC law. While the lack of registration would not affect the validity and enforceability of the lease agreements in practice, we may be required by the relevant governmental authorities to complete such registration, or otherwise be subject to fines ranging from RMB1,000 to RMB10,000 for each lease agreement that has not been registered. </p>

 <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">According to the PRC fire safety laws and regulations, construction and renovation of buildings are subject to fire control approvals or fire control filings. A portion of the properties we use do not fully comply with the fire control approval or fire control filing requirements primarily because we have a colossal network of schools and subsidiaries and different local authorities may have different practices in enforcing the regulatory requirements. We also cannot assure you that the properties we lease in the future would fully comply with the relevant fire control laws and regulations. If our use of the properties is challenged by relevant government authorities for lack of fire control procedures, we may be subject to fines and may need to relocate our operations to other locations, which would incur additional expenses. If we fail to find suitable replacement sites in a timely manner or on terms acceptable to us, our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. As of the date of this annual report, we were not asked to relocate by any competent authority for lack of fire control procedures. To prevent the reoccurrence of such <span style="white-space:nowrap">non-compliances,</span> we have formulated management measures on property leasing which require our schools to investigate the fire control procedure status of a property and evaluate its fire control risk before leasing it, and complete the subsequent fire control procedures if required. For existing leased properties lacking fire control procedures, we also encourage our schools to voluntarily relocate when condition permits to reduce our compliant risk. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:bold"><span style="font-style:italic">Any failure to comply with laws and regulations regarding food safety, product quality, online sales and online livestreaming could subject us to fines, penalties, other administrative measures or liability claims and may harm our reputation. </span></p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As East Buy sells food and other products under the brand name East Buy (<span style="font-family:pmingliu; font-size:9pt">&#19996;&#26041;&#29956;&#36873;</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:10pt">), food safety and product quality are critical to East Buy&#8217;s reputation and business success. The PRC Food Safety Law and PRC Product Quality Law along with related regulations provide for a series of obligations and restrictions on food and other product distributers. Although East Buy implements quality control standards and measures throughout its entire operating processes, there is no assurance that East Buy&#8217;s quality control systems will prove to be effective at all times, or that it can identify any defects in our quality control systems in a timely manner. East Buy also conducts livestreaming events on Douyin, a short-video platform that is popular in China, as well as other sales channels, including its own App, and sells products online, and therefore needs to comply with online livestreaming and online sales related regulations. For instance, according to the Online Livestreaming Service Administrative Measures, it is prohibited to publish information that endanger national security or infringe third-party rights. In addition, the Trial Administrative Measures for Online Livestreaming Sales and Marketing issued on April&#160;23, 2021 and effective from May&#160;25, 2021 stipulate that, among others, online livestreaming channel operators have the obligation to ensure the information provided are genuine and complies with laws, and such online livestreaming channel operators shall also check and record information regarding the products and suppliers. The State Administration for Market Regulation published the Measures for the Supervision and Management of Live Streaming <span style="white-space:nowrap">E-commerce</span> (Draft for Comments) in June 2025 and further published the Measures for the Supervision and Management of the Implementation of Food Safety Main Responsibilities in Live Streaming <span style="white-space:nowrap">E-commerce</span> (Draft for Comments) in August 2025. These drafts strengthened live-streaming platforms&#8217; responsibilities and specified liabilities and penalties for <span style="white-space:nowrap">non-compliance.</span> As of the date of this annual report, these drafts have been released for public comment only, and their respective provisions and adoption or effective dates remain uncertain. </span></p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The <span style="white-space:nowrap">e-commerce</span> industry, and online retail in particular, is highly regulated by the PRC government. For example, the Pricing Law of the PRC prohibits a business operator from committing the specified unlawful pricing activities, such as dumping products at price below cost for the purpose of driving out rivals or monopolizing the market, using false or misleading prices to deceive consumers to transact, colluding with others to manipulate the market price, or conducting price discrimination against other business operators. In August 2018, the Standing Committee of the National People&#8217;s Congress promulgated the <span style="white-space:nowrap">E-Commerce</span> Law, which became effective on January&#160;1, 2019. The <span style="white-space:nowrap">E-Commerce</span> Law imposes a number of new requirements and obligations on <span style="white-space:nowrap">e-commerce</span> platform operators. In addition, on March&#160;15, 2021, the State Administration for Market Regulation promulgated Online Trading Supervision and Management Measures, which took effect from May&#160;1, 2021 and became an important departmental regulation for the implementation of the <span style="white-space:nowrap">E-commerce</span> Law. We have adopted a series of measures to comply with such requirements under the <span style="white-space:nowrap">E-Commerce</span> Law. We cannot assure you, however, that our current business operations meet the requirements under the <span style="white-space:nowrap">E-Commerce</span> Law in all respects. If the PRC governmental authorities determine that we are not in compliance with all the requirements under the <span style="white-space:nowrap">E-Commerce</span> Law and other applicable laws and rules, we may be subject to fines and/or other sanctions. As a result, we are subject to risks regarding the interpretation and implementation of PRC laws and regulations applicable to online retail businesses. We are required to obtain various licenses and permits from different regulatory authorities in order to distribute certain categories of products, for example, we have obtained Food Operation Licenses and Permits for Operating Publications. If we are unable to maintain and renew one or more of our licenses and certificates when their current term expires, or obtain such renewals on commercially reasonable terms, our operations could be disrupted. If the PRC government requires additional licenses or permits or provides stricter supervision requirements in the future in order for us to conduct our businesses, there is no guarantee that we would be able to obtain such licenses or permits or meet all the supervision requirements in a timely manner, or at all. </p>

For examples, the GMV generated from Douyin represented a majority of East Buy&#8217;s total GMV for the fiscal years ended May&#160;31, 2024 and 2025, and the trend may continue in the foreseeable future. We cannot assure you that we will continue to maintain our cooperative relationships with these sales channels and their respective affiliates in the future.

We could incur significant costs and efforts in either defending against or settling such claims. If there is a successful claim against us, we might be required to pay substantial damages or refrain from further sale of the products. We may be subject to potential liability under PRC law if we negligently participated or assisted in infringement activities associated with counterfeit goods, such as injunctions to cease infringing activities, rectification, compensation, administrative penalties and even criminal liability. Moreover, such third-party claims or administrative penalties could result in negative publicity and our reputation could be severely damaged. Any of these events could have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Under our standard form agreements, we require suppliers or third-party merchants to indemnify us for any losses we suffer or any costs that we incur due to any products we source from these suppliers or any products sold by these third-party merchants. However, not all of our agreements with suppliers and third-party merchants have such terms, and for those agreements that have such terms, we may not be able to successfully enforce our contractual rights and may need to initiate costly and lengthy legal proceedings in China to protect our rights. </p>

It also has adopted customer-friendly return and exchange policies that make it convenient and easy for customers to change their minds after completing purchases. East Buy may also be required by law to adopt new or amend existing return and exchange policies from time to time. For example, pursuant to the amended Consumer Protection Law, which became effective in March 2014, except for certain types of products, such as custom-made goods, fresh and perishable goods, consumers are generally entitled to return the products purchased within seven days upon receipt without giving any reasons when they purchase the products from business operators on the internet. These policies improve customers&#8217; shopping experience and promote customer loyalty, which in turn help us acquire and retain customers. However, these policies also subject East Buy to additional costs and expenses which East Buy may not recoup through increased revenue.

 <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On November&#160;7, 2018, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council issued the Opinions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and State Council on Deepening Reform in Preschool Education, or Preschool Opinions. The Preschool Opinions provide that <span style="white-space:nowrap">non-state</span> capital is prohibited from controlling <span style="white-space:nowrap">non-profit</span> kindergartens through contractual arrangements. In January 2019, the General Office of the State Council issued the Circular on Initiating the Rectification of Kindergartens Affiliated to the Residential Communities in Urban Areas, pursuant to which the community-affiliated kindergartens can only be registered as <span style="white-space:nowrap">non-profit</span> kindergartens. As of the date of this annual report, we have not been requested by competent government authorities to unwind the contractual arrangements over our kindergartens. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Preschool Opinions also provide that private kindergartens are prohibited from listing as public companies by themselves or through packaging with other assets; and listed companies are prohibited from investing in <span style="white-space:nowrap">for-profit</span> kindergartens using funds from the capital market and acquiring <span style="white-space:nowrap">for-profit</span> kindergarten assets with stock or cash consideration. As advised by our PRC legal counsel, Tian Yuan Law Firm, the prohibition of private kindergartens from listing as public companies shall not have retrospective effect on private kindergartens that are already operated by a listed company prior to the promulgation of the Preschool Opinions, and as we have been a public company since 2006, our kindergartens do not fall within &#8220;listing as public companies by themselves or through packaging with other assets.&#8221; After the promulgation of the Preschool Opinions, we did not make any investment in <span style="white-space:nowrap">for-profit</span> kindergartens using funds from the capital market or acquire any <span style="white-space:nowrap">for-profit</span> kindergartens assets with stock or cash consideration in order to comply with the Preschool Opinions. The contribution of kindergartens has been immaterial to our business; we derived less than 1% of our total net revenues from our kindergartens for each of the fiscal years ended May&#160;31, 2023, 2024 and 2025. Based on the foregoing, our PRC legal counsel is of the view that the restrictions of the Preschool Opinions on the investment in or acquisition of <span style="white-space:nowrap">for-profit</span> kindergartens would not materially and negatively impact our business and operations. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have been advised by our PRC legal counsel, however, that the interpretation and application of current and future PRC laws and regulations are subject to changes. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the PRC regulatory authorities will not in the future take a view that is contrary to the above opinion of our PRC legal counsel. For example, if the relevant government authorities take a different view from ours on the Preschool Opinions and determine that our <span style="white-space:nowrap">for-profit</span> and/or <span style="white-space:nowrap">non-profit</span> kindergartens shall be excluded from our company, we may be requested to unwind the contractual arrangements for some or all of our kindergartens. In addition, although we believe the provision of digital educational resources through our intelligent learning systems and devices shall not be considered as after-school tutoring activities, and we have not received any notice from the competent government authorities indicating that such activities are deemed as after-school tutoring activities, we cannot assure you that the competent government authorities will not take a contrary view to ours. In the event that the provision of digital academic educational resources through our intelligent learning systems and devices is deemed as after-school tutoring activities, the academic educational resources provided by our intelligent learning systems and devices to <span style="white-space:nowrap">K-9</span> students shall comply with all regulations related to academic after-school tutoring, including, among others, the Alleviating Burden Opinion. Our PRC operating entities of the intelligent learning systems and devices may then be deemed as Academic AST Institutions, and these entities will be prohibited from being controlled by us as the Alleviating Burden Opinion prohibits foreign ownership in Academic AST Institutions, including through contractual arrangements. Under such circumstances, we may be requested to unwind the contractual arrangements with respect to the operating entities of intelligent learning systems and devices. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">It is uncertain whether any new PRC laws, rules or regulations relating to variable interest entity structures will be adopted or if adopted, what they would provide. In particular, whether and how the Foreign Investment Law promulgated in March 2019 and effective on January&#160;1, 2020, will impact the viability of our current corporate structure, corporate governance and business operations. See &#8220;&#8212;Risks Related to Doing Business in China&#8212;The interpretation and implementation of the Foreign Investment Law are subject to changes and it remains uncertain as to how it may impact the viability of our current corporate structure, corporate governance, business, financial condition and results of operations.&#8221; </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have been further advised by our PRC legal counsel that if we and/or any of our PRC subsidiaries or consolidated affiliated entities are found to be in violation of any existing or future PRC laws or regulations or fail to obtain or maintain any of the required permits or approvals, the relevant PRC regulatory authorities, including the Ministry of Education, which regulates the education industry, would have wide discretion within their scope of authority in dealing with such violations, including: </p> <p style="font-size:6pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">&#160;</p>

The equity pledges of shareholders of the variable interest entities under these equity pledge agreements have been registered with the relevant local branch of the State Administration for Market Regulation. According to the Civil Code of PRC, the pledgee and the pledgor are prohibited from making an agreement prior to the expiration of the debt performance period to transfer the ownership of the pledged equity to the pledgee. However, under the Civil Code of PRC, when an obligor fails to pay its debt when due, the pledgee may choose to either conclude an agreement with the pledgor to obtain the pledged equity or seek payments from the proceeds of the auction or <span style="white-space:nowrap">sell-off</span> of the pledged equity. If any of the VIEs or any of the shareholders of the VIEs fails to perform its obligations secured by the pledges under the equity pledge agreements, one remedy in the event of default under the agreements is to require the pledgor to sell the equity interests of the variable interest entity in an auction or private sale and remit the proceeds to our subsidiaries in China, net of related taxes and expenses. Such an auction or private sale may not result in our receipt of the full value of the equity interests in the variable interest entity. We consider it very unlikely that the public auction process would be undertaken since, in an event of default, our preferred approach is to ask our PRC subsidiary, a party to the option agreement with the shareholder of the variable interest entities, to designate another PRC person or entity to replace the shareholder pursuant to the direct transfer option we have under the option agreement. </p>

The equity pledge agreements with New Oriental China&#8217;s shareholder provide that the pledged equity interest shall constitute continuing security for any and all of the indebtedness, obligations and liabilities under all of the principal service agreements and the scope of pledge shall not be limited by the amount of the registered capital of New Oriental China. However, it is possible that a PRC court may take the position that the amount listed on the equity pledge registration forms represents the full amount of the collateral that has been registered and perfected. If this is the case, the obligations that are supposed to be secured in the equity pledge agreements in excess of the amount listed on the equity pledge registration forms could be determined by the PRC court as unsecured debt, which takes last priority among creditors and often does not have to be paid back at all. We do not have agreements that pledge the assets of New Oriental China and its schools and subsidiaries for the benefit of us or our wholly-owned subsidiaries. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:bold"><span style="font-style:italic">The controlling shareholder of Century Friendship, which is the sole shareholder of New Oriental China, may have potential conflicts of interest with us, and if any such conflicts of interest are not resolved in our favor, our business may be materially and adversely affected. </span></p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">New Oriental China is the sole shareholder of Beijing Xuncheng as of May&#160;31, 2025. New Oriental China is wholly owned by Century Friendship, a PRC domestic company which is controlled by Mr.&#160;Michael Minhong Yu, our founder and executive chairman. The interests of Mr.&#160;Yu as the controlling shareholder of the entity which owns New Oriental China may differ from the interests of our company as a whole, since Mr.&#160;Yu is only one of the beneficial owners of our company, holding 12.5% of our total common shares outstanding as of September&#160;15, 2025. We cannot assure you that when conflicts of interest arise, Mr.&#160;Yu will act in the best interests of our company or that conflicts of interests will be resolved in our favor. In addition, Mr.&#160;Yu may breach or cause New Oriental China and its schools and subsidiaries to breach or cause Beijing Xuncheng and its subsidiaries to breach or refuse to renew the existing contractual arrangements with us. Currently, we do not have existing arrangements to address potential conflicts of interest Mr.&#160;Yu may encounter in his capacity as a beneficial owner and director of New Oriental China, on the one hand, and as a beneficial owner and director of our company, on the other hand; provided that we could, at all times, exercise our option under the option agreement with Century Friendship to cause it to transfer all of its equity ownership in New Oriental China to a PRC entity or individual designated by us, and this new shareholder of New Oriental China could then appoint a new director of New Oriental China to replace Mr.&#160;Yu. In addition, if such conflicts of interest arise, Beijing Pioneer could also, in the capacity of Century Friendship&#8217;s <span style="white-space:nowrap"><span style="white-space:nowrap">attorney-in-fact</span></span> as provided under the proxy agreement and power of attorney, directly appoint a new director of New Oriental China to replace Mr.&#160;Yu. We rely on Century Friendship and Mr.&#160;Yu to comply with the laws of China, which protect contracts, including the contractual arrangements New Oriental China and its schools and subsidiaries and its shareholder have entered into with us, which provide that directors and executive officers owe a duty of loyalty to our company and require them to avoid conflicts of interest and not to take advantage of their positions for personal gains. We also rely on Mr.&#160;Yu to abide by the laws of the Cayman Islands, which provide that directors have a duty of care and a duty of loyalty to act honestly in good faith with a view to our best interests. However, the legal frameworks of China and the Cayman Islands do not provide guidance on resolving conflicts in the event of a conflict with another corporate governance regime. If we cannot resolve any conflicts of interest or disputes between us and Century Friendship and Mr.&#160;Yu, we would have to rely on legal proceedings, which could result in disruption of our business and subject us to substantial uncertainty as to the outcome of any such legal proceedings. </p>

We generally execute legal documents by affixing chops or seals, rather than having the designated legal representatives sign the documents. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have three major types of chops&#8212;corporate chops, contract chops and finance chops. We use corporate chops generally for documents to be submitted to government agencies, such as applications for changing business scope, directors or company name, and for legal letters. We use contract chops for executing leases and commercial contracts. We use finance chops generally for making and collecting payments, including, but not limited to issuing invoices. Use of corporate chops and contract chops must be approved by our legal department and administrative department, and use of finance chops must be approved by our finance department. The chops of our subsidiaries and the consolidated affiliated entities are generally held by the relevant entities so that documents can be executed locally. Although we usually utilize chops to execute contracts, the registered legal representatives of our PRC subsidiaries and the consolidated affiliated entities have the apparent authority to enter into contracts on behalf of such entities without chops. All designated legal representatives of our PRC subsidiaries and the consolidated affiliated entities are members of our or the respective entity&#8217;s senior management who have signed employment agreements with us under which they agree to abide by duties they owe to us. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In order to maintain the physical security of our chops, we generally have them stored in secured locations accessible only to the department heads of the legal, administrative or finance departments. Our designated legal representatives generally do not have access to the chops. Although we monitor our employees, including the designated legal representatives of our PRC subsidiaries and the consolidated affiliated entities, the procedures may not be sufficient to prevent all instances of abuse or negligence. There is a risk that our employees or designated legal representatives could abuse their authority, for example, by binding the relevant subsidiary or consolidated affiliated entity with contracts against our interests, as we would be obligated to honor these contracts if the other contracting party acts in good faith in reliance on the apparent authority of our chops or signatures of our legal representatives. If any designated legal representative obtains control of the chop in an effort to obtain control over the relevant entity, we would need to have a shareholder or board resolution to designate a new legal representative and to take legal action to seek the return of the chop, apply for a new chop with the relevant authorities, or otherwise seek legal remedies for the legal representative&#8217;s misconduct. If any of the designated legal representatives obtains and misuses or misappropriates our chops and seals or other controlling intangible assets for whatever reason, we could experience disruption to our normal business operations. We may have to take corporate or legal action, which could involve significant time and resources to resolve while distracting management from our operations. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:bold"><span style="font-style:italic">Our ability to operate private schools may be subject to significant limitations or may otherwise be materially and adversely affected by changes in PRC laws, regulations and policies. </span></p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Laws, regulations and policies governing PRC private education are subject to ongoing changes, which may materially affect our ability to operate private schools.

See &#8220;&#8212;Risks Related to Our Business&#8212;Significant risks exist in relation to the interpretation and implementation of, or proposed changes to, the PRC laws, regulations and policies regarding the private education industry. In particular, our compliance with the Opinions on Further Alleviating the Burden of Homework and After-School Tutoring for Students in Compulsory Education and the implementation measures issued thereunder by the relevant PRC government authorities has had, and could have further, material adverse effect on us&#8221; In November 2018, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council issued the Preschool Opinions. In January 2019, the General Office of the State Council issued the Circular on Initiating the Rectification. It is uncertain as to how the Preschool Opinions and the Circular on Initiating the Rectification will be interpreted and implemented. To the extent that we are not able to fully comply with these requirements, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. See &#8220;&#8212;If the PRC government finds that the agreements that establish the structure for operating some of our China business do not comply with applicable PRC laws and regulations relating to the relevant industries, or if these regulations or the interpretation of existing regulations change in the future, we could be subject to severe penalties or be forced to relinquish our interests in those operations.&#8221; </p>

The contractual arrangements with the VIEs may be subject to scrutiny by the PRC tax authorities, and a finding that we owe additional taxes could substantially reduce our consolidated net income and the value of your investment. We could face material and adverse tax consequences if the PRC tax authorities determine that the contractual arrangements among our subsidiaries in China and the VIEs, do not represent an <span style="white-space:nowrap">arm&#8217;s-length</span> price and adjust the consolidated affiliated entities&#8217; income in the form of a transfer pricing adjustment. A transfer pricing adjustment could, among other things, result in a reduction, for PRC tax purposes, of expense deductions recorded by the consolidated affiliated entities, which could in turn increase their tax liabilities. In addition, the PRC tax authorities may impose late payment fees and other penalties to the consolidated affiliated entities for under-paid taxes. Our consolidated net income may be materially and adversely affected if our tax liabilities increase or if we are found to be subject to late payment fees or other penalties. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:bold"><span style="font-style:italic">We may rely on dividends and other distributions on equity paid by our wholly-owned subsidiaries to fund any cash and financing requirements we may have, and any limitation on the ability of our subsidiaries or New Oriental China and its schools and subsidiaries to make payments to us could have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business. </span></p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are a holding company, and we may rely on dividends from our wholly-owned subsidiaries in China and service and other fees paid to our wholly-owned subsidiaries by New Oriental China and its schools and subsidiaries for our cash requirements, including any debt we may incur.

In addition, each of our subsidiaries and New Oriental China and its subsidiaries in China is required to set aside at least 10% of its <span style="white-space:nowrap">after-tax</span> profits each year, if any, to fund a statutory reserve until such reserve reaches 50% of its registered capital. These reserves are not distributable as cash dividends. Furthermore, if our subsidiaries and New Oriental China and its schools and subsidiaries in China incur debt on their own behalf in the future, the instruments governing the debt may restrict their ability to pay dividends or make other payments to us. In addition, the PRC tax authorities may require us to adjust our taxable income under the contractual arrangements we currently have in place in a manner that would materially and adversely affect our subsidiaries&#8217; ability to pay dividends and other distributions to us. Moreover, at the end of each fiscal year, every private school under the classification system of requiring reasonable returns and not requiring reasonable returns in China is required to allocate a certain amount to its development fund for the construction or maintenance of the school or procurement or upgrade of educational equipment. In the case of a private school that requires reasonable returns, this amount shall be no less than 25% of the annual net income of the school, while in the case of a private school that does not require reasonable returns, this amount shall be equivalent to no less than 25% of the annual increase in the net assets of the school, if any.

 <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Any loans to our PRC subsidiaries or New Oriental China and its schools and subsidiaries are subject to PRC regulations. For example, loans by us to our wholly-owned subsidiaries in China, each of which is a foreign-invested enterprise, to finance their activities cannot exceed statutory limits and must be registered with the PRC State Administration of Foreign Exchange, or SAFE, or its local counterparts. Loans by us to New Oriental China and its schools and subsidiaries, which are domestic PRC entities, must be approved by the relevant government authorities and must also be registered with SAFE or its local counterparts. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We may also decide to finance our PRC subsidiaries by means of capital contributions. These capital contributions must be filing and reporting to the PRC Ministry of Commerce or its local counterparts. We are unlikely, however, to finance the activities of New Oriental China and its schools and subsidiaries by means of capital contributions due to regulatory issues related to foreign investment in domestic PRC entities, as well as the licensing and other regulatory issues. SAFE promulgated the Notice of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange on Reforming the Administration of Foreign Exchange Settlement of Capital of Foreign-invested Enterprises, or SAFE Circular 19, effective in June 2015, in replacement of former regulations. According to SAFE Circular 19, the flow and use of the RMB capital converted from foreign currency-denominated registered capital of a foreign-invested company is regulated such that RMB capital may not be used for the issuance of RMB entrusted loans, the repayment of inter-enterprise loans or the repayment of bank loans that have been transferred to a third-party. Although SAFE Circular 19 allows RMB capital converted from foreign currency-denominated registered capital of a foreign-invested enterprise to be used for equity investments within China, it also reiterates the principle that RMB converted from the foreign currency-denominated capital of a foreign-invested company may not be directly or indirectly used for purposes beyond its business scope. Thus, it is unclear whether in practice SAFE will permit such capital to be used for equity investments in China. SAFE promulgated the Notice of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange on Reforming and Standardizing the Foreign Exchange Settlement Management Policy of Capital Account, or SAFE Circular 16, effective on June&#160;9, 2016, which reiterates some of the rules set forth in SAFE Circular 19, but changes the limitation on the use of RMB capital converted from foreign currency-denominated registered capital of a foreign-invested company from prohibiting using such capital to issue RMB entrusted loans to prohibiting using such capital to issue loans to <span style="white-space:nowrap">non-associated</span> enterprises. Violations of SAFE Circular 19 and SAFE Circular 16 could result in administrative penalties. SAFE Circular 19 and SAFE Circular 16&#160;may, significantly limit our ability to transfer any foreign currency we hold, which may adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to fund and expand our business in China. On October&#160;23, 2019, SAFE promulgated the Notice for Further Advancing the Facilitation of Cross-border Trade and Investment, which, among other things, allows all foreign-invested companies to use RMB converted from foreign currency-denominated capital for equity investments in China, for so long as there is a truthful equity investment, and such equity investment does not violate applicable laws and complies with the negative list on foreign investment. In December 2023, SAFE promulgated the Circular on Further Deepening Reforms to Facilitate Cross-border Trade and Investment, which, among other things, provides that the use of capital funds of <span style="white-space:nowrap">non-financial</span> enterprises, foreign exchange income under foreign debt and RMB funds derived from foreign exchange settlement shall follow the principle of truthfulness and for own use, and shall not be used directly or indirectly for expenditures prohibited by national laws and regulations; unless otherwise expressly provided, it shall not be used directly or indirectly for investment in securities or other investment and wealth management (except for wealth management products and structured deposits with risk ratings of not higher than Level&#160;2); and it shall not be used for the issuance of loans to <span style="white-space:nowrap">non-affiliated</span> enterprises (except for those expressly permitted in the scope of business and the four specific areas of China); and shall not be used for the purchase of <span style="white-space:nowrap"><span style="white-space:nowrap">non-self-use</span></span> residential properties (except for enterprises engaged in real estate development and operation and real estate leasing and operation). Such circular further specifies that in the event of any inconsistency between the previous regulations and this circular, this circular shall prevail. See also &#8220;Item 4.

If New Oriental China liquidates, we may take part in the liquidation procedures as a general creditor under the PRC Enterprise Bankruptcy Law and recover any outstanding liabilities owed by New Oriental China to our PRC subsidiaries under the applicable service agreements. To ameliorate the risks of an involuntary liquidation proceeding initiated by a third-party creditor, we closely monitor the operations and finances of New Oriental China through carefully designed budgetary and internal controls to ensure that New Oriental China is well capitalized and is highly unlikely to trigger any third-party monetary claims in excess of its assets and cash resources.

In addition, under the equity pledge agreements signed by the shareholder of New Oriental China and the Civil Code of PRC, the shareholder of New Oriental China does not have the right to issue dividends to itself or otherwise distribute the retained earnings or other assets of New Oriental China without our consent. Also, under the proxy agreement and power of attorney, the shareholder of New Oriental China undertakes to Beijing Pioneer, our wholly-owned PRC subsidiary, that if it receives, among other things, any dividends, residual assets upon liquidation or proceeds from the transfer of its equity interest in New Oriental China, it will, to the extent permitted under applicable law, remit all such dividends, residual assets and proceeds to Beijing Pioneer without any compensation or other consideration. In the event that the shareholder of New Oriental China initiates a voluntary liquidation proceeding without our authorization or attempts to distribute the retained earnings or assets of New Oriental China without our prior consent, we may need to resort to legal proceedings to enforce the terms of the contractual agreements.

In addition, the Chinese government continues to play a significant role in regulating industry development by imposing industrial policies.

The Russia-Ukraine conflict, the Hamas-Israel conflict and the attacks on shipping in the Red Sea have heightened geopolitical tensions across the world. The impact of the Russia-Ukraine conflict on Ukraine food exports has contributed to increases in food prices and thus to inflation more generally. There have also been concerns about the relationship between China and other countries which may potentially have economic effects. In particular, there is significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the United States and China with respect to a wide range of issues including trade policies, treaties, government regulations and tariffs. Since early 2025, the U.S. government has implemented significant changes to U.S. trade policy with China and imposed additional tariffs on imports from China, which has had and may continue to have a material impact on U.S.-China relations and the Chinese and global economy. Economic conditions in China are sensitive to global economic conditions, as well as changes in domestic economic and political policies and the expected or perceived overall economic growth rate in China. Any prolonged slowdown in the PRC or global economy may have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition, and continued turbulence in the international markets may adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:bold"><span style="font-style:italic">Uncertainties with respect to the enforcement of laws, and changes in laws and regulations in China could adversely affect us </span></p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our operations in China are governed by PRC laws and regulations. Our subsidiaries are generally subject to laws and regulations applicable to foreign investments in China and, in particular, laws applicable to wholly foreign-owned enterprises. The PRC legal system is based on written statutes. Prior court decisions may be cited for reference but have limited precedential value. As China is a fast-growing economy, China is in the process of developing fully integrated legal system in order to regulate different aspects of economic activities and recently enacted laws and regulations may not sufficiently cover all aspects of economic activities in China. In addition, the PRC legal system is based in part on government policies and internal rules and interpretations. As a result, we may not be fully compliant with these laws, regulations and policies, as well as their interpretations and implementations. In addition, any litigation in China may be time-consuming and may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention from the operation of our business. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:bold"><span style="font-style:italic">The PRC government&#8217;s oversight and discretion over our business operations could result in a material adverse change in our operations and the value of our ADSs and common shares. </span></p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We conduct our business primarily in China.

 <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The PRC government has recently indicated an intent to exert more oversight over overseas offerings by and foreign investment in China-based issuers like us. For example, on July&#160;6, 2021, PRC government authorities promulgated the Opinions on Lawfully and Strictly Cracking Down Illegal Securities Activities, which stated that the administration and supervision of overseas-listed China-based companies will be strengthened, and the special provisions of the State Council on overseas issuance and listing of shares by such companies will be revised, clarifying the responsibilities of the relevant domestic industry regulatory authorities and other regulatory authorities. On February&#160;17, 2023, the CSRC promulgated the Circular of the People&#8217;s Republic of China on Administrative Arrangements for Filing of Overseas Offering and Listing of Domestic Enterprises, or the Circular of Overseas Listing and Offering, and the Trial Administrative Measures of the Overseas Securities Offering and Listing by Domestic Companies and five relevant guidelines, or the Overseas Listing Trial Measures. The Overseas Listing Trial Measures became effective on March&#160;31, 2023. Pursuant to the Overseas Listing Trial Measures, PRC domestic companies that seek to offer and list securities in overseas markets, either in direct or indirect means, are required to fulfill the filing procedure with the CSRC and report relevant information. According to the Circular of Overseas Listing and Offering, issuers that have already been listed in an overseas market by March&#160;31, 2023, such as our company, are not required to make any immediate filing. However, under the Overseas Listing Trial Measures, such issuers will be required to complete certain filing procedures with the CSRC in connection with future securities offerings and listings outside of mainland China, including <span style="white-space:nowrap">follow-on</span> offerings, issuance of convertible bonds, offshore relisting after going-private transactions, and other equivalent offering activities. We cannot assure you that any new rules or regulations promulgated in the future will not impose additional requirements on us. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, the Cybersecurity Review Measures stipulate certain circumstances that may trigger the cybersecurity review by the Cyberspace Administration of China. See &#8220;&#8212;Risks Related to Our Business&#8212;Failure to comply with governmental regulation and other legal obligations concerning privacy, data protection and cybersecurity may subject us to penalties, damage our reputation and brand, and may materially and adversely affect our business, as we routinely collect, store and use data during our business&#8221; for more details. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">It remains uncertain how PRC government authorities will regulate overseas listing in general in the future and whether we are required to complete filing or obtain any specific regulatory approvals from the CSRC, Cyberspace Administration of China or any other PRC government authorities for our overseas offerings. If the CSRC, Cyberspace Administration of China or other government authorities later promulgate new rules or explanations requiring that we obtain their approvals for our future overseas offerings, we may be unable to obtain such approvals in a timely manner, or at all, and such approvals may be rescinded even if obtained. Any such circumstance could significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to continue to offer securities to investors and cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or be worthless. In addition, implementation of industry-wide regulations directly targeting our operations could cause the value of our securities to significantly decline. Therefore, investors of our company and our business face potential uncertainty from actions taken by the PRC government affecting our business. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:bold"><span style="font-style:italic">The interpretation and implementation of the Foreign Investment Law are subject to changes and it remains uncertain as to how it may impact the viability of our current corporate structure, corporate governance, business, financial condition and results of operations. </span></p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On March&#160;15, 2019, the National People&#8217;s Congress promulgated the Foreign Investment Law, which came into effect on January&#160;1, 2020 and replaced the Sino-foreign Equity Joint Venture Enterprise Law, the Sino-foreign Cooperative Joint Venture Enterprise Law and the Wholly Foreign-invested Enterprise Law, together with their implementation rules and ancillary regulations. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Its interpretation and implementation are subject to changes, and failure to take timely and appropriate measures to comply with the Foreign Investment Law and relevant rules could result in material and adverse effects on us. For instance, although the Foreign Investment Law does not explicitly classify contractual arrangements as a form of foreign investment, it contains a <span style="white-space:nowrap">catch-all</span> provision under the definition of &#8220;foreign investment,&#8221; which includes investments made by foreign investors in China through means stipulated by laws or administrative regulations or other methods prescribed by the State Council. Therefore, it still leaves leeway for future laws, administrative regulations or provisions to be promulgated by the State Council to provide for contractual arrangements as a form of foreign investment, at which time it will be uncertain whether our contractual arrangements will be deemed to be in violation of the market access requirements for foreign investment in the PRC and, if so, how our contractual arrangements will be dealt with. In addition, if future laws, administrative regulations or provisions to be prescribed by the State Council mandate further actions to be taken by companies with respect to existing contractual arrangements, we may face substantial uncertainties as to whether we can complete such actions in a timely manner, or at all. In the worst case scenario, we may be required to unwind our existing contractual arrangements and/or dispose of the relevant business operations, which could have a material and adverse effect on our current corporate structure, corporate governance, business, financial condition and results of operations. </p>

Pursuant to the Alleviating Burden Opinion and the State Council Circular 80, institutions providing after-school tutoring services on academic subjects shall obtain the private school operation permit. The State Council Circular 80 and the Amended Implementation Rules further require the learning centers of a training school providing after-school tutoring services to make filings with the relevant education authorities. For the <span style="white-space:nowrap">non-academic</span> tutoring services, the Alleviating Burden Opinion requires that local governmental authorities shall clarify the competent authorities for administering the <span style="white-space:nowrap">non-academic</span> after-school tutoring institutions, by classifying sports, culture and art, science and technology and other <span style="white-space:nowrap">non-academic</span> subjects, formulate standards among different classification of <span style="white-space:nowrap">non-academic</span> tutoring and conduct strict examination before granting permission. As of the date of this annual report, certain local governmental authorities have promulgated rules that require <span style="white-space:nowrap">non-academic</span> tutoring service providers in areas such as art, music, physics, among others, to obtain private school operation permit. Due to the complex and evolving regulatory environment of the after-school tutoring industry, we cannot assure you that we have obtained and maintained all requisite private school operation permits and filings for all of our tutoring institutions and learning centers, or the scope of private school operation permits and filings we are holding are sufficient for our tutoring activities. We are in the process of applying or renewing the private school operation permits for some of our tutoring institutions. However, there is also no assurance that we will be able to update or renew the existing permits and filings on a timely basis, or at all. We may be subject to fines, confiscation of the gains derived from our noncompliant operations, or suspension of our operations, for any <span style="white-space:nowrap">non-compliance</span> incidents occurred from time to time, which may materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. Furthermore, the Alleviating Burden Opinion further provides that administration and supervision over academic subjects tutoring institutions for students in grade ten to twelve shall be implemented by reference to the relevant provisions of the Alleviating Burden Opinion, however, it remains uncertain as to how and to what extent the administration over academic subjects tutoring institutions for students in grade ten to twelve will be implemented by reference of the Alleviating Burden Opinion. Therefore, we cannot assure you that we would not be required to take further actions, including obtaining operation permits, regarding our academic tutoring services for students in grade ten to twelve to comply with the Alleviating Burden Opinion and its implementation measures. In addition, our <span style="white-space:nowrap">e-commerce</span> business is operated by our majority-owned subsidiary, East Buy, and we are required to obtain a number of licenses, permits and approvals in order to provide such services.

Any failure to obtain or delay in obtaining such approval or completing such filing procedures for our offshore offerings, or a rescission of any such approval or filing if obtained by us, would subject us to sanctions by the CSRC or other PRC regulatory authorities for failure to seek CSRC approval or filing or other government authorization for our offshore offerings. These regulatory authorities may impose fines and penalties on our operations in China, limit our ability to pay dividends outside of China, limit our operating privileges in China, delay or restrict the repatriation of the proceeds from our offshore offerings into China or take other actions that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects, as well as the trading price of our listed securities. The CSRC or other PRC regulatory authorities also may take actions requiring us, or making it advisable for us, to halt our offshore offerings before settlement and delivery of the shares offered.

If we fail to make adequate employee benefit payments, we may be subject to fines, late fees and legal sanctions, and our business, financial conditions and results of operations may be adversely affected. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:bold"><span style="font-style:italic">Governmental control of currency conversion may affect the value of your investment. </span></p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The PRC government imposes controls on the convertibility between the RMB and foreign currencies and, in certain cases, the remittance of currency out of China. We receive substantially all of our revenues in RMB. Under our current corporate structure, our income at the holding company level may be primarily derived from dividend payments from our PRC subsidiaries. Shortages in the availability of foreign currency may restrict the ability of our PRC subsidiaries and New Oriental China and its schools and subsidiaries to remit sufficient foreign currency to pay dividends or other payments to us, or otherwise satisfy their foreign currency denominated obligations. Under existing PRC foreign exchange regulations, payments of current account items, including profit distributions, interest payments and expenditures from trade-related transactions, can be made in foreign currencies without prior approval from SAFE by complying with certain procedural requirements. However, approval from appropriate government authorities is required where RMB is to be converted into foreign currency and remitted out of China to pay capital expenses such as direct investments, repayments of loans or investments in securities outside the PRC. The PRC government may also at its discretion restrict access in the future to foreign currencies for current account transactions. If the foreign exchange control system prevents us from obtaining sufficient foreign currency to satisfy our currency demands, we may not be able to pay dividends in foreign currencies to our shareholders, including holders of our ADSs. As a result, the funds in our PRC subsidiaries or the consolidated affiliated entities in China may not be available to fund operations or for other use outside of China due to interventions in, or the imposition of restrictions and limitations on, the ability of our holding company, our subsidiaries, or the consolidated affiliated entities by the PRC government on currency conversion. Although currently there are not equivalent or similar restrictions or limitations in Hong Kong on cash transfers in, or out of, our Hong Kong entities (including currency conversion), if certain restrictions or limitations in China were to become applicable to cash transfers in and out of Hong Kong entities (including currency conversion) in the future, the funds in our Hong Kong entities, likewise, may not be available to meet our currency demand. </p>

The Renminbi has fluctuated against the U.S. dollar, at times significantly and unpredictably. The value of Renminbi against the U.S. dollar and other currencies is affected by changes in China&#8217;s political and economic conditions and by China&#8217;s foreign exchange policies, among other things. We cannot assure you that Renminbi will not appreciate or depreciate significantly in value against the U.S. dollar in the future. It is difficult to predict how market forces or PRC or U.S. government policy may impact the exchange rate between Renminbi and the U.S. dollar in the future. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our revenues and costs are mostly denominated in the RMB, and a significant portion of our financial assets are also denominated in RMB. We may rely entirely on dividends and/or other fees paid to us by our subsidiaries and New Oriental China and its schools and subsidiaries in China. Any significant appreciation or depreciation of Renminbi may materially and adversely affect our revenues, earnings and financial position, and the value of, and any dividends payable on, our common shares and ADSs. For example, a further appreciation of the RMB against the U.S. dollar would make any new <span style="white-space:nowrap">RMB-denominated</span> investments or expenditures more costly to us, to the extent that we need to convert U.S. dollars into the RMB for such purposes. Conversely, a significant depreciation of the RMB against the U.S. dollar may significantly reduce our reported earnings in U.S. dollars, which in turn could adversely affect the price of our common shares and ADSs. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Very limited hedging options are available in China to reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations.

In addition, our currency exchange losses may be magnified by PRC exchange regulations that restrict our ability to convert Renminbi into foreign currency. As a result, fluctuations in exchange rates may have a material adverse effect on your investment. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:bold"><span style="font-style:italic">The discontinuation of any preferential tax treatments currently available to us could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. </span></p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Chinese government has provided various tax incentives to certain of our PRC subsidiaries, primarily in the form of reduced enterprise income tax rates. For example, under the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law and its implementation rules, the statutory enterprise income tax rate is 25%. However, the income tax of an enterprise that has been determined to be a high and new technology enterprise can be reduced to a preferential rate of 15%. In addition, an enterprise that qualifies as a &#8220;software enterprise&#8221; is exempt from enterprise income tax for the two years beginning in the enterprise&#8217;s first profitable year and then is entitled to a reduced tax rate of 12.5% for the succeeding three years. Any increase in the enterprise income tax rate applicable to certain of our PRC subsidiaries in China, or any discontinuation, retroactive or future reduction or refund of any of the preferential tax treatments currently enjoyed by certain of our PRC subsidiary in China, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Before September&#160;1, 2017, under the Law for Promoting Private Education, or the Private Education Law, and its Implementation Rules, private schools that do not require reasonable returns enjoy the same preferential tax treatment as public schools, while the preferential tax treatment policies applicable to private schools requiring reasonable returns shall be separately formulated by the relevant authorities under the State Council. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Amended Private Education Law, which became effective on September&#160;1, 2017 and was further amended on December&#160;29, 2018, no longer uses the term &#8220;reasonable return.&#8221; Instead, under the Amended Private Education Law, sponsors of private schools may choose to establish <span style="white-space:nowrap">non-profit</span> or <span style="white-space:nowrap">for-profit</span> private schools at their own discretion, except that private schools in compulsory education area can only be registered as <span style="white-space:nowrap">non-profit</span> private schools, and after-school tutoring institutions providing tutoring services on academic subjects in compulsory education area can only be registered as <span style="white-space:nowrap">non-profit</span> private schools under the Alleviating Burden Opinion.

 <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Currently, tax treatments for private schools vary across different cities in China. Private schools in certain cities are subject to a 25% standard enterprise income tax, while in other cities, private schools are subject to a fixed amount of enterprise income tax each year as determined by the local tax authority in lieu of the 25% standard enterprise income tax or are not required to pay enterprise income tax at all. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Preferential tax treatments granted to us by governmental authorities are subject to review and may be adjusted or revoked at any time in the future. The discontinuation of any preferential tax treatments currently available to us, especially to those schools in major cities, will cause our effective tax rate to increase, which will increase our income tax expenses and in turn decrease our net income. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:bold"><span style="font-style:italic">We may be treated as a resident enterprise for PRC tax purposes under the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law, which may subject us to PRC income tax for our global income and withholding for any dividends we pay to our <span style="white-space:nowrap">non-PRC</span> shareholders and ADS holders. </span></p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Under the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law, enterprises established outside of China whose &#8220;de facto management bodies&#8221; are located in China are considered &#8220;resident enterprises,&#8221; and will generally be subject to the uniform 25% enterprise income tax rate for their global income. Although the term &#8220;de facto management bodies&#8221; is defined as &#8220;management bodies which has substantial and overall management and control power on the operation, human resources, accounting and assets of the enterprise,&#8221; the circumstances under which an enterprise&#8217;s &#8220;de facto management body&#8221; would be considered to be located in China are currently unclear. The State Administration of Taxation has issued a circular providing that a foreign enterprise controlled by a PRC company or a PRC company group will be classified as a &#8220;resident enterprise&#8221; with its &#8220;de facto management bodies&#8221; located within China if the following requirements are satisfied: (1)&#160;the senior management and core management departments in charge of its daily operations function mainly in the PRC; (2)&#160;its financial and human resources decisions are subject to determination or approval by persons or bodies in the PRC; (3)&#160;its major assets, accounting books, company seals, and minutes and files of its board and shareholders&#8217; meetings are located or kept in the PRC; and (4)&#160;at least half of the enterprise&#8217;s directors or senior management with voting rights reside in the PRC. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, the State Administration of Taxation issued a bulletin to provide more guidance on the implementation of the above circular. The bulletin clarified certain matters relating to resident status determination, post determination administration and competent tax authorities. It also specifies that when provided with a copy of a PRC tax resident determination certificate from a resident <span style="white-space:nowrap">PRC-controlled</span> offshore incorporated enterprise, the payer should not withhold 10% income tax when paying the <span style="white-space:nowrap">PRC-sourced</span> dividends, interest and royalties to the <span style="white-space:nowrap">PRC-controlled</span> offshore incorporated enterprise. Moreover, the State Administration of Taxation issued a bulletin in January 2014, to provide more guidance on the implementation of the above circular. This bulletin further provided that, among other things, an entity that is classified as a &#8220;resident enterprise&#8221; in accordance with the circular shall file the application for classifying its status of residential enterprise with the local tax authorities where its main domestic investors registered. From the year in which the entity is determined as a &#8220;resident enterprise,&#8221; any dividend, profit and other equity investment gain shall be taxed in accordance with the Article 26 of the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law and the Article 17 and Article 83 of its implementation rules. Although both the circular and the bulletin only apply to offshore enterprises controlled by PRC enterprises and not those by PRC individuals, the determination criteria set forth in the circular and administration clarification made in the bulletin may reflect the State Administration of Taxation&#8217;s general position on how the &#8220;de facto management body&#8221; test should be applied in determining the tax residency status of offshore enterprises and how the administration measures should be implemented, regardless of whether they are controlled by PRC enterprises or PRC individuals. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Most members of our management team are based in China and are expected to remain in China. Although our offshore holding companies are not controlled by any PRC company or company group, we cannot assure you that we will not be deemed to be a PRC resident enterprise under the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law and its implementation rules. If we are deemed to be a PRC resident enterprise, we will be subject to PRC enterprise income tax at the rate of 25% on our global income. In that case, however, dividend income we receive from our PRC subsidiaries may be exempt from PRC enterprise income tax because the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law and its implementation rules generally provide that dividends received by a PRC resident enterprise from its directly invested entity that is also a PRC resident enterprise is exempt from enterprise income tax. Accordingly, if we are deemed to be a PRC resident enterprise and earn income other than dividends from our PRC subsidiaries, a 25% enterprise income tax on our global income could significantly increase our tax burden and materially and adversely affect our cash flow and profitability. </p>

The State Council has reduced such rate to 10%, in the absence of any applicable tax treaties that may reduce such rate. We are a Cayman Islands holding company and may derive our income from dividends we receive from our operating subsidiaries located in the PRC. If we are required under the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law to pay income tax for any dividends we receive from our PRC subsidiaries, the amount of dividends, if any, we may pay to our shareholders and ADS holders may be materially and adversely affected. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">According to the Arrangement between the PRC and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region on the Avoidance of Double Taxation and Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income, or the Double Taxation Arrangement (Hong Kong), dividends paid to enterprises incorporated in Hong Kong are subject to a withholding tax of 5% provided that a Hong Kong resident enterprise owns over 25% of the PRC enterprise distributing the dividend and can be considered as a &#8220;beneficial owner&#8221; and entitled to treaty benefits under the Double Taxation Arrangement (Hong Kong). Elite Concept Holdings Limited, Winner Park Limited and Smart Shine International Limited, our Hong Kong wholly-owned subsidiaries, own 100% of some of our PRC subsidiaries. Thus, dividends paid by our PRC subsidiaries to us through our Hong Kong wholly-owned subsidiaries may be subject to the 5% withholding tax if we and our Hong Kong subsidiaries are considered as <span style="white-space:nowrap">&#8220;non-resident</span> enterprises&#8221; under the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law and our Hong Kong subsidiaries are considered as &#8220;beneficial owners&#8221; and entitled to treaty benefits under the Double Taxation Arrangement (Hong Kong). If our Hong Kong subsidiaries are not regarded as the beneficial owners of any such dividends, they will not be entitled to the treaty benefits under the Double Taxation Arrangement (Hong Kong).

As a result, gains derived from such indirect transfer may be subject to PRC enterprise income tax, and the transferee or other person who is obligated to pay for the transfer is obligated to withhold the applicable taxes, currently at a rate of 10% for the transfer of equity interests in a PRC resident enterprise. Bulletin 7 does not apply to transactions of sale of shares by investors through a public stock exchange where such shares were acquired from a transaction through a public stock exchange. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">According to Bulletin 7, where a <span style="white-space:nowrap">non-PRC</span> resident enterprise transfers its equity interests in a PRC resident enterprise to its related parties at a price lower than the fair market value, the competent tax authority has the power to make a reasonable adjustment to the taxable income of the transaction.

As a result, in certain circumstances it may be difficult to determine whether a certain license requirement applies to us and what actions or omissions may be deemed to be in violation of applicable laws and regulations. For example, according to the Administrative Provisions on Internet Audio-Visual Program Service, the dissemination of &#8220;Audio-visual Programs&#8221; through internet is subject to the specific license. However, due to the ambiguity of the definition of &#8220;Audio-visual Programs,&#8221; there is uncertainty as to whether our online business falls within the definition of &#8220;Audio-visual Programs&#8221; and whether we are required to obtain the License for Online Transmission of Audio-Visual Programs. In addition, pursuant to the Administrative Measures on the Production and Operation of Radio and Television Programs, the production of &#8220;Radio and Television Programs&#8221; requires the Permit for Production and Operation of Radio and TV Programs. Due to the ambiguity of the definition of &#8220;Radio and Television Programs,&#8221; there is uncertainty as to whether our online business falls within such definition. In addition, the interpretation of &#8220;online publishing service&#8221; remains uncertain. The online distribution of content, including our course materials, may be regarded as an &#8220;online publishing service&#8221; and we may be required to obtain an Online Publishing License. Although we have obtained an Online Publishing License, we cannot assure you that our Online Publishing License covers all services we currently provide that may be deemed as &#8220;online publishing&#8221;, and in the event that our Online Publishing License is found not to cover all such services, we may be required to obtain additional Online Publishing License or to update our existing Online Publishing License. If the government authorities deem printing and providing physical learning materials to users as &#8220;publishing&#8221; or &#8220;publication distribution,&#8221; we may be required to obtain a Permit for Operating Publications. Information posted on our mobile apps and websites may be viewed as news information, and the release of such information on our mobile apps and websites may be deemed as &#8220;Internet news information services&#8221; and therefore we may be required to obtain Internet news information licenses. Further, there is no definition of &#8220;online education activities&#8221; under the Amended Implementation Rules. If our online learning contents and products are deemed as &#8220;online education activities&#8221; under the Amended Implementation Rules, certain of our operating entities may be required to obtain a private school operating permit. Moreover, the Opinions on Guiding and Regulating the Orderly and Healthy Development of Educational Mobile Apps issued jointly by the Chinese Ministry of Education with certain other PRC government authorities on August&#160;10, 2019, require that mobile Apps that provide services for school teaching and management, student learning and student life, or home-school interactions, with school faculty, students or parents as the main users, and with education or learning as the main application scenarios, or the Education Apps, complete filings with competent provincial regulatory authorities for education. Following the issuance of these opinions, we completed filings for our Education Apps with relevant government authorities. However, to implement the Alleviating Burden Opinion, the Chinese Ministry of Education require all Educational Apps that have completed filings prior to the effective date of the Alleviating Burden Opinion to be <span style="white-space:nowrap">re-submit</span> filings to make sure they comply with relevant compliance requirements under the Alleviating Burden Opinion. As of the date of this annual report, we have already completed filings or otherwise <span style="white-space:nowrap">re-submitted</span> filings for our Educational Apps. If we fail to promptly complete such filing and comply with other applicable regulatory requirements, we may be blacklisted by the Chinese Ministry of Education or its local counterparts and prohibited from submitting any filings for six months, or may be subject to fines, regulatory orders to suspend our or the consolidated VIEs&#8217; operations or other regulatory and disciplinary sanctions. Furthermore, although we have obtained ICP Licenses, which specifically permit us to provide certain internet information services, due to potential changes with respect to the interpretation of relevant laws and regulations by PRC government authorities, we cannot assure you that our ICP Licenses cover all the telecommunication services we currently provide, and in the event that our ICP Licenses are found not to cover all the telecommunication services we currently provide, we may be required to obtain additional Value-Added Telecommunications Business Operating Licenses or to update our existing ICP Licenses. In addition, the Internet Culture Measures require ICP operators engaging in Internet culture activities to obtain an Internet culture operation license, or Internet Culture Operation License, from the Ministry of Culture in accordance with the Internet Culture Measures. The term &#8220;Internet culture activities&#8221; includes, among other things, online dissemination of Internet cultural products (such as audio-video products, gaming products, performances of plays or programs, works of art and cartoons) and the production, reproduction, importation, publication and broadcasting of Internet cultural products. On May&#160;14, 2019, the General Office of the Ministry of Culture promulgated the Notice on Adjusting the Scope of Internet Culture Operation License and Further Standardizing the Approval Work, which provides that activities including online performances fall in the scope of Internet Culture Operation License and further clarifies that educational live streaming activities are not online performances. Therefore, we are not required to obtain the Internet Culture Operation License for our online tutoring business. According to the Q&amp;A posted on the website of Ministry of Culture and Tourism of the PRC, if the main content of the livestreaming activities features on sale of goods, such livestreaming activities do not fall within the scope of internet culture activities, no Internet Culture Operation License is required. Since our livestreaming <span style="white-space:nowrap">e-commerce</span> business through East Buy is for providing the sale of agricultural and other products, we are not required to obtain the Internet Culture Operation License for our livestreaming <span style="white-space:nowrap">e-commerce</span> business. However, given the potential changes in the interpretation and application of existing PRC laws and regulations, we may be required to obtain the Internet Culture Operation License for business operations in the future. </p>

The auditor is located in mainland China, a jurisdiction where the PCAOB was historically unable to conduct inspections and investigations completely before 2022. As a result, we and investors in the ADSs were deprived of the benefits of such PCAOB inspections. The inability of the PCAOB to conduct inspections of auditors in China in the past has made it more difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of our independent registered public accounting firm&#8217;s audit procedures or quality control procedures as compared to auditors outside of China that are subject to the PCAOB inspections. On December&#160;15, 2022, the PCAOB issued a report that vacated its December&#160;16, 2021 determination and removed mainland China and Hong Kong from the list of jurisdictions where it is unable to inspect or investigate completely registered public accounting firms. However, if the PCAOB determines in the future that it no longer has full access to inspect and investigate completely accounting firms in mainland China and Hong Kong, and we use an accounting firm headquartered in one of these jurisdictions to issue an audit report on our financial statements filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, we and investors in our ADSs would be deprived of the benefits of such PCAOB inspections again, which could cause investors and potential investors in the ADSs to lose confidence in our audit procedures and reported financial information and the quality of our financial statements. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:bold"><span style="font-style:italic">Our ADSs may be prohibited from trading in the United States under the HFCAA in the future if the PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate completely auditors located in China.

If our shares and ADSs are prohibited from trading in the United States, there is no certainty that we will be able to list on a <span style="white-space:nowrap">non-U.S.</span> exchange or that a market for our shares will develop outside of the United States. A prohibition of being able to trade in the United States would substantially impair your ability to sell or purchase our ADSs when you wish to do so, and the risk and uncertainty associated with delisting would have a negative impact on the price of our ADSs. Also, such a prohibition would significantly affect our ability to raise capital on terms acceptable to us, or at all, which would have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and prospects. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:bold"><span style="font-style:italic">It may be difficult for overseas regulators to conduct investigations or collect evidence within China. </span></p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In China, there are more legal procedures to go through in order to obtain information needed for regulatory investigations or litigation initiated outside China, compared with legal procedures needed for obtaining information regarding investigations or litigation initiated inside China. Although the authorities in China may establish a regulatory cooperation mechanism with the securities regulatory authorities of another country or region to implement cross-border supervision and administration, such cooperation with the securities regulatory authorities in the Unities States may not be efficient in the absence of mutual and practical cooperation mechanism. Furthermore, according to Article 177 of the PRC Securities Law, which became effective in March 2020, no overseas securities regulator is allowed to directly conduct investigation or evidence collection activities within the territory of the PRC. While detailed interpretation of or implementation rules under Article 177 of the PRC Securities Law have yet to be promulgated, the inability for an overseas securities regulator to directly conduct investigations or evidence collection activities within China may further increase difficulties faced by our shareholders in protecting their interests. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Furthermore, on July&#160;6, 2021, the relevant PRC governmental authorities promulgated the Opinions on Lawfully and Strictly Cracking Down Illegal Securities Activities, among which, it is mentioned that the administration and supervision of overseas-listed China-based companies will be strengthened, and the special provisions of the State Council on overseas issuance and listing of shares by such companies will be revised, clarifying the responsibilities of domestic industry competent authorities and regulatory authorities.

In addition, in connection with the listing of our common shares on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, we obtained a number of waivers and/or exemptions from strict compliance with the Hong Kong Listing Rules, the Companies (Winding Up and Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance, the Takeovers Codes and the Securities and Futures Ordinance (Chapter 571 of the Laws of Hong Kong), as amended or supplemented from time to time.

 <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:bold"><span style="font-style:italic">Certain judgments obtained against us by our shareholders may not be enforceable. </span></p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are continued and registered in the Cayman Islands and conduct substantially all of our operations in China. Substantially all of our assets are located in China. All of our executive officers reside in China and some or all of the assets of those persons are located within China. As a result, it may be difficult for shareholders to effect service of process within the United States or Hong Kong in the event that they believe that their rights have been infringed under the U.S. federal securities laws, Hong Kong laws or otherwise. Even if shareholders are successful in bringing an action of this kind, the laws of the Cayman Islands and of the PRC may render shareholders unable to enforce a judgment against our assets or the assets of our directors and officers. There is no statutory enforcement in the Cayman Islands of judgments obtained in the Hong Kong courts or federal or state courts of the United States (and the Cayman Islands are not a party to any treaties for the reciprocal enforcement or recognition of such judgments). </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments are provided for under the PRC Civil Procedures Law. PRC courts may recognize and enforce foreign judgments in accordance with the requirements of the PRC Civil Procedures Law based either on treaties between China and the country where the judgment is made or on principles of reciprocity between jurisdictions. China does not have any treaties or other forms of reciprocity with the United States that provide for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments. In addition, according to the PRC Civil Procedures Law, the PRC courts will not enforce a foreign judgment against us or our director and officers if they decide that the judgment violates the basic principles of PRC laws or national sovereignty, security or public interest. As a result, it is uncertain whether and on what basis a PRC court would enforce a judgment rendered by a court in the United States. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">There is uncertainty as to whether the judgment of United States courts will be directly enforced in Hong Kong, as the United States and Hong Kong do not have a treaty or other arrangements providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments of courts of the United States in civil and commercial matters. However, a foreign judgment may be enforced in Hong Kong at common law by bringing an action in a Hong Kong court since the judgment may be regarded as creating a debt between the parties to it, provided that the foreign judgment, among other things, is a final judgment conclusive upon the merits of the claim and is for a liquidated amount in a civil matter and not in respect of taxes, fines, penalties, or similar charges. Such a judgment may not, in any event, be so enforced in Hong Kong if (a)&#160;it was obtained by fraud; (b)&#160;the proceedings in which the judgment was obtained were opposed to natural justice; (c)&#160;its enforcement or recognition would be contrary to the public policy of Hong Kong; (d)&#160;the court of the United States was not jurisdictionally competent; or (e)&#160;the judgment was in conflict with a prior Hong Kong judgment. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:bold"><span style="font-style:italic">Since we are a Cayman Islands exempted company, the rights of our shareholders may be more limited than those of shareholders of a company organized in the United States or Hong Kong. </span></p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our corporate affairs are governed by our third amended and restated memorandum and articles of association and by the Cayman Companies Act and the common law of the Cayman Islands. The rights of shareholders to take legal action against our directors and us, actions by minority shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors to us under Cayman Islands law are to a large extent governed by the common law of the Cayman Islands. The common law of the Cayman Islands is derived in part from comparatively limited judicial precedents in the Cayman Islands as well as from English common law, which has persuasive, but not binding, authority on a court in the Cayman Islands. The rights of our shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors under Cayman Islands law are not as clearly established as they would be under statutes or judicial precedents in the United States or in Hong Kong. In particular, the Cayman Islands has a less developed body of securities laws as compared to the United States or Hong Kong, and provides significantly less protection to investors. In addition, with respect to Cayman Islands companies, plaintiffs may face special obstacles, including but not limited to those relating to jurisdiction and standing, in attempting to assert derivative claims in state or federal courts of the United States. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As a result of all of the above, our shareholders may have more difficulties in protecting their interests through actions against our management, directors or major shareholders than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction in the United States or Hong Kong. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:bold"><span style="font-style:italic">Our articles of association contain anti-takeover provisions that could have a material adverse effect on the rights of holders of our common shares and ADSs. </span></p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our articles of association contain provisions that limit the ability of others to acquire control of our company or cause us to engage in <span style="white-space:nowrap"><span style="white-space:nowrap">change-of-control</span></span> transactions. These provisions could have the effect of depriving our shareholders of an opportunity to sell their shares at a premium over prevailing market prices by discouraging third parties from seeking to obtain control of our company in a tender offer or similar transaction. For example, our board of directors has the authority, without further action by our shareholders, to issue preferred shares in one or more series and to fix their designations, powers, preferences, privileges, and relative participating, optional or special rights and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions, including dividend rights, conversion rights, voting rights, terms of redemption and liquidation preferences, any or all of which may be greater than the rights associated with our common shares, in the form of ADS or otherwise. Preferred shares could be issued quickly with terms calculated to delay or prevent a change in control of our company or make removal of management more difficult. If our board of directors decides to issue preferred shares, the price of our common shares and ADSs may fall and the voting and other rights of the holders of our common shares and ADSs may be materially and adversely affected. </p>

Although the law in this regard is unclear, we treat the VIEs (including their subsidiaries) as being owned by us for U.S. federal income tax purposes, not only because we exercise effective control over the operation of such entities but also because we are entitled to substantially all of the economic benefits associated with these entities, and, as a result, we consolidate these entities&#8217; operating results in our combined financial statements. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Based upon the nature and composition of our assets (in particular, the retention of substantial amounts of cash, deposits and investments), and the market price of our ADSs, we believe that we were a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes for the taxable year ended May&#160;31, 2025, and we will likely be a PFIC for our current taxable year unless the market price of our ADSs increases and/or we invest a substantial amount of the cash and other passive assets we hold in assets that produce or are held for the production of active income. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If we are classified as a PFIC in any taxable year, a U.S. Holder (as defined in &#8220;Item 10. Additional Information&#8212;E. Taxation&#8212;U.S. Federal Income Taxation&#8221;) in our ADSs and/or common shares will generally be subject to reporting requirements and may incur significantly increased U.S. federal income tax on gain recognized on the sale or other disposition of the ADSs or common shares and on the receipt of distributions on the ADSs or common shares to the extent such gain or distribution is treated as an &#8220;excess distribution&#8221; under U.S. federal income tax rules. Further, if we are classified as a PFIC for any year during which a U.S. Holder holds our ADSs or common shares, we will generally continue to be treated as a PFIC for all succeeding years during which such U.S. Holder holds our ADSs or common shares. U.S. Holders of our ADSs or common shares are urged to consult their tax advisors concerning the United States federal income tax consequences if we are classified as a PFIC for any taxable year. See the discussion under &#8220;Item 10. Additional Information&#8212;E. Taxation&#8212;U.S. Federal Income Taxation &#8212;Passive Foreign Investment Company Rules&#8221; concerning the U.S. federal income tax consequences if we are or become classified as a PFIC. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:bold"><span style="font-style:italic">The different characteristics of the capital markets in Hong Kong and the U.S. may negatively affect the trading prices of our common shares and ADSs in different ways. </span></p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As dual-listed company, we are subject to Hong Kong and NYSE listing and regulatory requirements concurrently. The Hong Kong Stock Exchange and NYSE have different trading hours, trading characteristics (including trading volume and liquidity), trading and listing rules, and investor bases (including different levels of retail and institutional participation). As a result of these differences, the trading prices of our common shares and our ADSs may not be the same, even allowing for currency differences. Fluctuations in the price of our ADSs due to circumstances peculiar to the U.S. capital markets could materially and adversely affect the price of our common shares, or vice versa. Certain events having significant negative impact specifically on the U.S. capital markets may result in a decline in the trading price of our common shares notwithstanding that such event may not impact the trading prices of securities listed in Hong Kong generally or to the same extent, or vice versa. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:bold"><span style="font-style:italic">Exchange between our common shares and our ADSs may adversely affect the liquidity and/or trading price of each other. </span></p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our ADSs are currently traded on the NYSE. Subject to compliance with U.S. securities law and the terms of the deposit agreement, holders of our common shares may deposit common shares with the depositary in exchange for the issuance of our ADSs. Any holder of ADSs may also withdraw the underlying common shares represented by the ADSs pursuant to the terms of the deposit agreement for trading on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. In the event that a substantial number of common shares are deposited with the depositary in exchange for ADSs or vice versa, the liquidity and trading price of our common shares on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and our ADSs on the NYSE may be adversely affected. </p>

In addition, the time differences between Hong Kong and New York, unforeseen market circumstances or other factors may delay the deposit of common shares in exchange of ADSs or the withdrawal of common shares underlying the ADSs. Investors will be prevented from settling or effecting the sale of their securities during such periods of delay. In addition, there is no assurance that any exchange of common shares into ADSs (and vice versa) will be completed in accordance with the timelines that investors may anticipate. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Furthermore, the depositary for the ADSs is entitled to charge holders fees for various services including for the issuance of ADSs upon deposit of common shares, cancelation of ADSs, distributions of cash dividends or other cash distributions, distributions of ADSs pursuant to share dividends or other free share distributions, distributions of securities other than ADSs and annual service fees. As a result, shareholders who exchange common shares into ADSs, and vice versa, may not achieve the level of economic return the shareholders may anticipate. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:bold"><span style="font-style:italic">An active trading market for our common shares on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange might not develop or be sustained and trading prices of our common shares might fluctuate significantly. </span></p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Since the listing of our common shares on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, we have maintained a certain level of liquidity in the trading of our common shares on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.

The trading price or liquidity for our ADSs on the NYSE might not be indicative of those of our common shares on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.

Stock Connect currently covers over 2,000 equity securities trading in the Hong Kong, Shanghai and Shenzhen markets. Stock Connect allows mainland Chinese investors to trade directly in eligible equity securities listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, known as Southbound Trading; without Stock Connect, mainland Chinese investors would not otherwise have a direct and established means of engaging in Southbound Trading. However, it is unclear whether and when the common shares of our Company, with a secondary listing in Hong Kong upon the Listing, will be eligible to be traded through Stock Connect, if at all. The ineligibility or any delay of our common shares for trading through Stock Connect will affect mainland Chinese investors&#8217; ability to trade our common shares and therefore may limit the liquidity of the trading of our common shares on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:bold"><span style="font-style:italic">There is uncertainty as to whether Hong Kong stamp duty will apply to the trading or conversion of our ADSs. </span></p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In connection with our initial public offering of common shares in Hong Kong, or the Hong Kong IPO, we have established a branch register of members in Hong Kong, or the Hong Kong share register.

As of May&#160;31, 2025, we had a physical network of 77 schools and 1,241 learning centers in 70 cities and approximately 41,000 teachers. We deliver online courses through our online learning platforms, including Koolearn.com, our comprehensive online education platform. Powered by our OMO system, we have combined our offline network with online technologies and adopted different business models tailored to students in different locations to facilitate our operational efficiency. For example, for students in most cities, we primarily deliver courses in offline classroom settings, supported with interactive online learning components. For students in lower-tier cities, we broadcast courses delivered by well-known teachers from <span style="white-space:nowrap">top-tier</span> cities through our OMO system, and the local assistant lecturers monitor and provide <span style="white-space:nowrap">in-person</span> guidance and interactions with students onsite. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We distribute and sell books and other educational materials developed or licensed by us through our distribution channels, which consist of bookstores operated by us and third-party distributors. As of May&#160;31, 2025, we had eight bookstores operated by us, and 262 third-party distributors, who provided us with access to a nationwide network of online and offline bookstores. In addition, we have an extensive network of students and alumni, who we believe have been essential in helping us promote our brand and our programs, services and products by <span style="white-space:nowrap"><span style="white-space:nowrap">word-of-mouth</span></span> referrals. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Almost all of the schools, learning centers and bookstores that we operate are under our &#8220;New Oriental&#8221; brand. Our schools in major cities consist of classrooms and administrative facilities with full student and administrative services, while our schools in satellite cities and our learning centers consist primarily of classroom facilities and limited course registration and management capabilities. We select new locations for our schools and learning centers based on various factors, including demographics, the number of schools or colleges in, and the economic condition of, the particular region. We have opened bookstores in some of our established schools to sell educational materials relating to our courses and also sell self-help, <span style="white-space:nowrap">know-how,</span> inspirational and other books. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We ceased our <span style="white-space:nowrap">K-9</span> Academic AST Services at the end of 2021 and closed certain schools and learning centers in connection with the cessation of our <span style="white-space:nowrap">K-9</span> Academic AST Services.

Course fees are determined based on factors such as the length of the course, the size and the subject of the class, and the geographic location of the school. We offer flexible class sizes for our courses, including larger classes that range from 6 to 200 students per class and small classes that range from one to five students per class. Our educational program, service and product offerings include five major areas: test preparation courses, <span style="white-space:nowrap">non-academic</span> tutoring, intelligent learning system and devices, overseas study consulting services and educational materials and distribution.<span style="font-weight:bold"> </span>In compliance with the Alleviating Burden Opinion and applicable rules, regulations and measures, we ceased offering <span style="white-space:nowrap">K-9</span> Academic AST Services in China at the end of 2021. We deconsolidated Beijing Changping New Oriental Bilingual School and Beijing New Oriental Yangzhou Foreign Language School, two private schools that provide compulsory education, from our company in September 2021 in compliance with Amended Implementation Rules for the Private Education Law. Historically, East Buy operated our pure-play online learning platforms. In March 2024, our wholly-owned subsidiary and New Oriental China completed the acquisition of East Buy&#8217;s online education business. Upon completion, the online education business was deconsolidated from East Buy&#8217;s consolidated financial statements and is now recorded by us primarily under test preparation courses. </p>

It sets forth provisions relating to the fundamental education systems of the PRC, including a school education system comprising kindergarten education, primary education, secondary education and higher education, a system of nine-year compulsory education, a national education examination system, and a system of education certificates. It stipulates that the State formulates plans for the development of education, establishes and operates schools and other educational institution. Furthermore, it provides that enterprises, other social organizations and individual citizens are encouraged to establish and operate schools and other types of educational institutions in accordance with PRC laws. It also provides that some basic conditions shall be met for the establishment of a school or any other educational institution, and the establishment, modification or termination of a school or any other educational institution shall, in accordance with the relevant PRC laws, go through the formalities of examination, verification, approval, registration or filing for record. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The 2009 amended Education Law prohibits any organization or individual from establishing or operating a school or any other educational institution for profit-making purposes. In December 2015, the Education Law was further amended with effect from June 2016. The 2015 amended Education Law abolishes the aforesaid provision and was subsequently amended on April&#160;29, 2021. After the effectiveness of the 2015 amended Educational Law, establishing or operating schools for profit-making purposes is allowed under the newly amended Education Law.

 <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Prior to its amendment in 2016, private education is treated as a public welfare undertaking in all aspects. Nonetheless, investors of a private school may choose to require &#8220;reasonable returns&#8221; from the annual net balance of the school after deduction of costs, donations received, government subsidies, if any, the reserved development fund and other expenses as required by the regulations. Private schools were divided into three categories: private schools established with donated funds; private schools that require reasonable returns and private schools that do not require reasonable returns. A duly approved private school will be granted a private school operation permit and shall be registered with the Ministry of Civil Affairs or its local counterparts as a privately run <span style="white-space:nowrap">non-enterprise</span> institution. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Every private school was required to allocate a certain amount to its development fund for the construction or maintenance of school facilities or procurement or upgrade of educational equipment. In the case of a private school that required reasonable returns, this amount shall be no less than 25% of the annual net income of the school, while in the case of a private school that did not require reasonable returns, this amount shall be equal to no less than 25% of the annual increase in the net assets of the school, if any. Private schools that do not require reasonable returns shall be entitled to the same preferential tax treatment as public schools, while the preferential tax treatment policies applicable to private schools requiring reasonable returns shall be formulated by the finance authority, taxation authority and other authorities under the State Council. To date, however, no regulations have been promulgated by the relevant authorities in this regard. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On November&#160;7, 2016, the Standing Committee of the National People&#8217;s Congress promulgated the Amended Private Education Law, which became effective on September&#160;1, 2017.

Instead, a new classification system for private schools on the basis of whether they are established and operated for profit-making purposes is adopted. Under the new classification system, sponsors of private school may choose to establish <span style="white-space:nowrap">non-profit</span> or <span style="white-space:nowrap">for-profit</span> private schools at their own discretion, save for private schools providing compulsory education are not allowed to be registered as <span style="white-space:nowrap">for-profit.</span> The key differences between <span style="white-space:nowrap">for-profit</span> private schools and <span style="white-space:nowrap">non-profit</span> private schools under this system include the following: </p> <p style="font-size:6pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">&#160;</p>

The opinions also provide that each level of the government shall increase their support to the private schools in terms of financial investment, financial support, autonomy policies, preferential tax treatments, land policies, fee policies, autonomy operation, protection of the rights of teachers and students etc. Further, the opinions require each level of the government to improve local policies on government support to <span style="white-space:nowrap">for-profit</span> and <span style="white-space:nowrap">non-profit</span> private schools by such means as preferential tax treatments. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On December&#160;30, 2016, the Chinese Ministry of Education, Ministry of Civil Affairs, the State Administration for Market Regulation, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Welfare and the State Commission Office of Public Sectors Reform jointly issued the Implementation Rules on the Classification Registration of Private Schools to reflect the new classification system for private schools as set out in the Amended Private Education Law.

 <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><span style="font-style:italic">Sponsorship of Private Schools </span></p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Under the Law for Promoting Private Education and the Implementation Rules for Promoting Private Education, entities and individuals that establish private schools are referred to as &#8220;sponsors.&#8221; </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Before September&#160;1, 2017, the date the 2016 Amended Private Education Law became effective, the &#8220;sponsorship interest&#8221; that a sponsor holds in a private school is, for all practical purposes, substantially equivalent under PRC law and practice to the &#8220;equity interest&#8221; a shareholder holds in a company. Pursuant to the Implementation Rules for Promoting Private Education, a sponsor of a private school has the obligation to make capital contributions to the school in a timely manner. The contributed capital can be in the form of tangible or <span style="white-space:nowrap">non-tangible</span> assets such as materials in kind, land use rights or intellectual property rights. Pursuant to the Law for Promoting Private Education, the capital contributed by the sponsor becomes assets of the school and the school has independent legal person status. In addition, pursuant to the Law for Promoting Private Education and the Implementation Rules for Promoting Private Education, the sponsor of a private school has the right to exercise ultimate control over the school. Specifically, the sponsor has control over the private school&#8217;s constitutional documents and has the right to elect and replace the private school&#8217;s decision making bodies, such as the school&#8217;s board of directors, and therefore controls the private school&#8217;s business and affairs. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As of September&#160;1, 2017, we were not aware that PRC law provides that upon liquidation of a private school, the sponsor is legally restricted to receive only its invested capital and is not allowed to have other return. As of September&#160;1, 2017, there was no national law that addresses this subject one way or the other. In the absence of a national law providing for the sponsor&#8217;s rights upon liquidation of a private school, provincial regulations and interpretations are ambiguous and inconsistent on this subject. There were local regulations or interpretations that specifically provide that sponsors are entitled to private schools&#8217; residual assets pro rata based on their respective capital contribution. Nevertheless, there were also local regulations that are less clear in this regard. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Notwithstanding the legal uncertainties surrounding this issue, we believe that the potential risk that we will not receive all of the residual assets upon the liquidation of a school is immaterial. There were no capital contributions made by any PRC governmental authorities to our schools. Nor did any of our schools ever receive donations from any third parties, including PRC governmental authorities or any third party enterprises. Neither we nor our PRC legal counsel is aware of any case in China where a private school which has been solely funded by private sponsors without any government or donated funds became state property or was otherwise appropriated by a government authority upon liquidation without the prior consent of its sponsor. We historically have never liquidated any school that was profitable and we have no plan to do so in the future unless required by the laws and regulations. If, for any reason, we would like to divest a profitable school, a commercially sensible way to do so is to sell the school, rather than to liquidate the school. In this situation, the sponsor is entitled to receive consideration for transferring sponsorship, which often exceeds its initial investment in the school. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Upon the effectiveness of the 2016 Amended Private Education Law in September 2017, sponsors of <span style="white-space:nowrap">for-profit</span> private schools are entitled to retain the profits and proceeds from the schools and the operation surplus may be allocated to the sponsors pursuant to the PRC Company Law and other relevant laws and regulations, whereas sponsors of <span style="white-space:nowrap">non-profit</span> private schools are not entitled to the distribution of profits or proceed from the <span style="white-space:nowrap">non-profit</span> schools and all operation surplus of <span style="white-space:nowrap">non-profit</span> schools shall be used for the operation of the schools. The remaining assets of <span style="white-space:nowrap">non-profit</span> private schools after liquidation shall continue to be used for the operation of other <span style="white-space:nowrap">non-profit</span> schools, whereas the remaining assets of <span style="white-space:nowrap">for-profit</span> private schools shall be distributed to the sponsors in accordance with the PRC Company Law. </p>

The State Council Circular 80 provides for the conditions for approval and registration of after-school tutoring institutions, and requires relevant governmental authorities to tighten regulations on after-school tutoring institutions. The State Council Circular 80 specifies operating requirements that after-school tutoring institutions must meet. Such requirements include, among other things, that after-school tutoring institutions (i)&#160;have fixed training premises that conform to specified safety criteria, with an average area per student of no less than three square meters during the applicable training period; (ii)&#160;comply with relevant fire safety, environmental protection, hygiene, food operation and other specified requirements; (iii)&#160;purchase personal safety insurance for students to reduce safety risks; and (iv)&#160;not hire teachers who are working concurrently in primary or secondary schools, and teachers tutoring in academic subjects such as English are required to have the corresponding teaching qualifications. After-school tutoring institutions are prohibited from carrying out training that goes beyond the school syllabus, training in advance of the corresponding school schedule and any training activities linked with student admission, nor shall they organize any level test, rank examination or competition on academic subjects for primary and secondary students. According to State Council Circular 80, extracurricular training institutions are also required to disclose and file relevant information, including their training content, schedule, targeted students and school timetable to the relevant education authority, and their training classes may not end later than 8:30&#160;p.m. each day. After-school tutoring institutions can only collect in advance fees for courses spanning three months or shorter.

The Notice stipulates that local education and market regulation authorities shall increase the efforts for the investigation of after-school tutoring institutions&#8217; illegal acts which infringes customers&#8217; rights by using unfair standard terms to exempt their own liability, increase customers&#8217; liability and exclude customers&#8217; legal rights. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On March&#160;30, 2021, the Chinese Ministry of Education promulgated the Guiding Opinions of the Ministry of Education on Vigorously Promoting the Scientific Connection of Kindergartens and Primary Schools, which prohibits after-school tutoring institutions from providing training for <span style="white-space:nowrap">pre-school</span> children in violation of regulations and provides that after-school tutoring institutions in violation of regulations above shall be included in the blacklist. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On April&#160;8, 2021, the General Office of the Chinese Ministry of Education enacted the Notice of Strengthening the Management of Homework for Compulsory Education, which requires that the local governments shall implement prohibition measures on leaving homework as an important part of the daily supervision on after-school training institutions in accordance with relevant regulations, and in order to avoid reducing the burden in schools but increasing the burden after-school, after-school training institutions shall not leave homework to primary and secondary school students. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On July&#160;24, 2021, the General Office of State Council and the General Office of Central Committee of the Communist Party of China jointly promulgated the Opinions on Further Alleviating the Burden of Homework and After-School Tutoring for Students in Compulsory Education, or the Alleviating Burden Opinion, which provides that, among other things, (i)&#160;local government authorities shall no longer approve new after-school tutoring institutions providing tutoring services on academic subjects for students in compulsory education, and the existing after-school tutoring institutions providing tutoring services on academic subjects shall be registered as <span style="white-space:nowrap">non-profit;</span> (ii)&#160;online Academic AST Institutions that have filed with the local education administration authorities providing tutoring services on academic subjects shall be subject to review and <span style="white-space:nowrap">re-approval</span> procedures by competent government authorities, and any failure to obtain such approval will result in the cancellation of its previous filing and ICP license; (iii)&#160;Academic AST Institutions are prohibited from raising funds by listing on stock markets or conducting any capitalization activities and listed companies are prohibited from investing in Academic AST Institutions through capital markets fund raising activities, or acquiring assets of Academic AST Institutions by paying cash or issuing securities; and (iv)&#160;foreign capital is prohibited from controlling or participating in any Academic AST Institutions through mergers and acquisitions, entrusted operation, joining franchise or variable interest entities. </p>

The Preschool Opinions laid out overall requirements for the reform and development of preschool education and specified measures to be taken in eight areas: planning and distribution of kindergartens, expansion of preschool education resources, long-term funding mechanisms, teaching workforce, supervision systems, regulation of private kindergartens, childcare and teaching quality, and administrative systems. The Preschool Opinions aim to increase the accessibility of preschool education to children and see the <span style="white-space:nowrap">pre-school</span> gross enrollment rate reach 85% by 2020. The Preschool Opinions propose to build a preschool education system centered on kindergartens with universal access (including public kindergartens and private kindergartens with universal access) and expect the coverage of kindergartens with universal access amount to 80% by 2020. The Preschool Opinions demand the regulation on the development of private kindergartens, including that <span style="white-space:nowrap">(i)&#160;non-state</span> capital is prohibited from controlling <span style="white-space:nowrap">non-profit</span> kindergartens through acquisitions and contractual arrangements, and (ii)&#160;private kindergartens are prohibited from listing as public companies by themselves or through packaging with other assets; and listed companies are not allowed to invest in <span style="white-space:nowrap">for-profit</span> kindergartens using funds from the capital market, or acquire <span style="white-space:nowrap">for-profit</span> kindergarten assets with stock or cash consideration. It is uncertain whether it would become illegal to use contractual arrangements to consolidate operation results of kindergartens under the new regulation regime, and the above rules may materially affect our expansion and operation of kindergartens in the future. On November&#160;8, 2024, the Standing Committee of the National People&#8217;s Congress published the Preschool Education Law, which repeats the provisions restricting kindergartens from pursuing profits and sets forth the legal liabilities for violation of such provisions. </p>

If the data have not been informed or publicly announced as important data by relevant authorities or regions, data processors are not required to report security assessments for their outbound data transfers as important data. Furthermore, critical information infrastructure operators transferring personal information or important data overseas, or data processors other than critical information infrastructure operators transferring important data overseas or cumulatively transferring over one million individuals&#8217; personal information (excluding sensitive personal information) or 10,000 or more individuals&#8217; sensitive personal information overseas from January&#160;1 of the current year, shall in each case apply for a data cross-border security assessment to the CAC through CAC&#8217;s local branch.

Network data processors that conduct network data processing activities affecting or potentially affecting national security shall undergo national security review in accordance with relevant state regulations. For data recognized as important data, the relevant regions and departments shall promptly notify the network data processors or publicly release such designation.

Business operators may not sell products at a premium or charge any fees that are not explicitly indicated.

Both the foreign and domestic parties of a Sino-foreign cooperative school shall be educational institutions with the commensurate qualification for running schools and a good track record in providing high quality education. However, no implementing measures or specific guidance has been released as to what specific criteria must be met by the foreign party to demonstrate to the relevant authority that it meets the qualification requirements.

The FITE Regulations stipulate that the foreign investor of a telecommunications enterprise is prohibited from holding more than 50% of the equity interest in a foreign-invested enterprise that provides value-added telecommunications services. Moreover, foreign investors that intend to invest in or establish a value-added telecommunications enterprise operating the value-added telecommunications business must obtain approvals from the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology and the Ministry of Commerce, or their authorized local counterparts, which retain considerable discretion in granting approvals. </p>

The provincial communications administration bureaus, as local authorities in charge of regulating telecommunications services, may revoke the value-added telecommunications business operation licenses of those who fail to comply with the above requirements or fail to rectify such noncompliance within specified time limits. Due to the lack of any additional interpretation from the regulatory authorities, it remains unclear what impact Ministry of Industry and Information Technology Circular 2006 will have on us or the other PRC internet companies with similar corporate structures and contractual arrangements. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On April&#160;8, 2024, the MIIT issued the Circular on Pilot Work of Expanding the Opening Up of Value-Added Telecommunications Services, pursuant to which, the foreign ownership limits on several services, including (i)&#160;Internet Data Center, (ii)&#160;Content Delivery Networks, (iii)&#160;Internet Access Services, (iv)&#160;online data processing and transaction, (v)&#160;information publishing platform and delivery services (except Internet news and information, online publishing, online audiovisual, Internet culture business), and (vi)&#160;information protection and processing services in designated pilot areas, are eliminated.

 <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:bold"><span style="font-style:italic">Regulations on Foreign Currency Exchange </span></p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Pursuant to applicable PRC regulations on foreign currency exchange, RMB is freely convertible to current account items, such as trade-related receipts and payments, interest and dividend. Capital account items, such as direct equity investments, loans and repatriation of investment, require the prior approval from SAFE or its local counterpart or prior registration with banks for conversion of RMB into a foreign currency. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Domestic companies or individuals can repatriate payments received from abroad in foreign currencies or deposit those payments abroad. Foreign-invested enterprises may retain foreign exchange in accounts with designated foreign exchange banks. Foreign exchange on the current account and capital account can be either retained or sold to financial institutions that have foreign exchange settlement or sales business based on the need of the enterprise without prior approval from SAFE, subject to certain restrictions. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">SAFE promulgated the Circular on the Relevant Operating Issues Concerning the Improvement of the Administration of the Payment and Settlement of Foreign Currency Capital of Foreign Invested Enterprises, or SAFE Circular 142, to regulate the conversion by a foreign-invested company of its capital contribution in foreign currency into RMB. The circular requires that the <span style="white-space:nowrap">paid-in</span> capital of a foreign-invested company settled in RMB converted from foreign currencies shall be used only for purposes within the business scope as approved by the authorities in charge of foreign investment or by other competent authorities and as registered with the local branch of Administration for Industries and Commerce and, unless set forth in the business scope or in PRC regulations, may not be used for equity investments within the PRC. In addition, SAFE has strengthened its oversight of the flow and use of the <span style="white-space:nowrap">paid-in</span> capital of a foreign-invested company settled in RMB converted from foreign currencies. The use of such RMB <span style="white-space:nowrap">paid-in</span> capital may not be changed without SAFE&#8217;s approval. Violations of Circular 142 will result in severe monetary or other penalties. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">SAFE promulgated SAFE Circular 19, effective in June 2015 to abolish SAFE Circular 142. According to SAFE Circular 19, the flow and use of the RMB capital converted from foreign currency-denominated registered capital of a foreign-invested company is regulated such that RMB capital may not be used for the issuance of RMB entrusted loans, the repayment of inter-enterprise loans or the repayment of banks loans that have been transferred to a third-party. Although SAFE Circular 19 allows RMB capital converted from foreign currency-denominated registered capital of a foreign-invested enterprise to be used for equity investments within China, it also reiterates the principle that RMB converted from the foreign currency-denominated capital of a foreign-invested company may not be used, directly or indirectly, for purposes beyond its business scope. Therefore, foreign-invested companies&#8217; applications to make equity investment with their capital were often rejected on the ground of exceeding the business scope. SAFE promulgated SAFE Circular 16, effective on June&#160;9, 2016, which reiterates some of the rules set forth in SAFE Circular 19, but changes the limitation on the use of RMB capital converted from foreign currency-denominated registered capital of a foreign-invested company from prohibiting using such capital to issue RMB entrusted loans to prohibiting using such capital to issue loans to <span style="white-space:nowrap">non-associated</span> enterprises. Violations of SAFE Circular 19 and SAFE Circular 16 could result in administrative penalties. SAFE Circular 19 and SAFE Circular 16&#160;may significantly limit our ability to transfer any foreign currency we hold to our PRC subsidiary, which may adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to fund and expand our business in China. On October&#160;23, 2019, SAFE promulgated SAFE Circular 28, which, among other things, allows all foreign-invested companies to use RMB converted from foreign currency-denominated capital for equity investments in China, for so long as there is a truthful equity investment, such equity investment does not violate applicable laws, and such equity investment complies with the negative list on foreign investment. SAFE Circular 28 aims to lift the restriction on foreign-invested companies&#8217; equity investment with capital on the ground of business scope implied by SAFE Circular 19. According to the Circular of SAFE on Optimizing Foreign Exchange Administration to Support the Development of Foreign-related Business promulgated and effective on April 10, 2020 by SAFE, the reform of facilitating the payments of income under the capital accounts shall be promoted nationwide. Under the prerequisite of ensuring true and compliant use of funds and compliance and complying with the prevailing administrative provisions on use of income from capital projects, enterprises which satisfy the criteria are allowed to use income under the capital account, such as capital funds, foreign debt and overseas listing, etc., for domestic payment, without the need to provide proof materials for veracity to the bank beforehand for each transaction. </p>

The M&amp;A Rule, as amended on June&#160;22, 2009, provides that the Ministry of Commerce must be notified in advance of any <span style="white-space:nowrap"><span style="white-space:nowrap">change-of-control</span></span> transaction in which a foreign investor takes control of a PRC domestic enterprise and any of the following situations exists: (1)&#160;the transaction involves an important industry in China, (2)&#160;the transaction may affect national &#8220;economic security,&#8221; or (3)&#160;the PRC domestic enterprise has a well-known trademark or historical Chinese trade name in China. Complying with the requirements of the M&amp;A Rules to complete acquisitions of PRC companies by foreign investors could be time-consuming, and any required approval processes, including obtaining approval from the Ministry of Commerce, may delay or inhibit the ability to complete such transactions. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On February&#160;17, 2023, with the approval of the State Council, the CSRC released the Trial Administrative Measures of Overseas Securities Offering and Listing by Domestic Companies, or the Overseas Listing Trial Measures, and five supporting guidelines, which came into effect on March&#160;31, 2023. According to the Overseas Listing Trial Measures, (1)&#160;domestic companies that seek to offer or list securities overseas, both directly and indirectly, should fulfill the filing procedure and report relevant information to the CSRC; (2)&#160;if the issuer meets both of the following conditions, the overseas offering and listing shall be determined as an indirect overseas offering and listing by a domestic company: (i)&#160;any of the total assets, net assets, revenues or profits of the domestic operating entities of the issuer in the most recent accounting year accounts for more than 50% of the corresponding figure in the issuer&#8217;s audited consolidated financial statements for the same period; (ii)&#160;its major operational activities are carried out in China or its main places of business are located in China, or the senior managers in charge of operation and management of the issuer are mostly Chinese citizens or are domiciled in China; and (3)&#160;where a domestic company seeks to indirectly offer and list securities in an overseas market, the issuer shall designate a major domestic operating entity responsible for all filing procedures with the CSRC, and where an issuer makes an application for initial public offering and listing in an overseas market, the issuer shall submit filings with the CSRC within three business days after such application is submitted. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On the same day, the CSRC held a press conference for the release of the Overseas Listing Trial Measures and issued the Notice on Administration for the Filing of Overseas Offering and Listing by Domestic Companies, which, among others, clarifies that (1)&#160;domestic companies that have been listed on a foreign stock exchange prior to the effective date of the Overseas Listing Trial Measures are not required to go through the filing procedure immediately but may be required to go through the filing procedure if future fund raising activities are involved; (2)&#160;a <span style="white-space:nowrap">six-month</span> transition period will be granted to domestic companies which, prior to the effective date of the Overseas Listing Trial Measures, have already obtained the approval from overseas regulatory authorities or stock exchanges (such as the completion of hearing in the market of Hong Kong or the completion of registration in the market of the United States), but have not completed the indirect overseas listing; if domestic companies fail to complete the overseas listing within such <span style="white-space:nowrap">six-month</span> transition period, they are required to file with the CSRC according to the requirements; and (3)&#160;the CSRC will solicit opinions from relevant regulatory authorities and complete the filing of the overseas listing of companies with contractual arrangements which duly meet the compliance requirements, and support the development and growth of these companies by enabling them to utilize two markets and two kinds of resources. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On February&#160;24, 2023, the CSRC jointly with other government authorities issued the Provisions on Strengthening Confidentiality and Archives Administration of Overseas Securities Offering and Listing by Domestic Companies, or the Overseas Listing Archives Rules, as a supporting rule to the Overseas Listing Trial Measures, which came into effect on March&#160;31, 2023. Pursuant to the Overseas Listing Archives Rules, domestic companies that seek to offer or list securities overseas directly or indirectly, and securities companies and securities related service providers providing services to such domestic companies shall establish confidentiality and archives administration system, adopt requisite measures to perform the responsibilities of confidentiality and archives administration, and shall not divulge state secrets and state agencies&#8217; work secrets, or harm state and public interests. The Overseas Listing Archives Rules provide, among others, that before providing or disclosing any document or material which involve state secrets or state agencies&#8217; work secrets, domestic companies shall apply to the competent government authorities for approval and file with the secrecy administration authorities for record. </p>

In addition, pursuant to the Measures for Handling Matters Relating to Preferential Enterprise Income Tax Policies promulgated by the State Administration of Taxation on April&#160;25, 2018, or Circular 23, an enterprise shall independently judge whether it satisfies the conditions prescribed under preferential taxation policies. The enterprises which satisfy such conditions shall calculate the tax reduction amount and enjoy the preferential tax treatments by filling out and submitting the enterprise income tax returns to the competent tax authority, and properly collect and retain relevant materials for future reference. For software enterprises, materials listed in the <span style="white-space:nowrap">&#8220;follow-up</span> management requirements,&#8221; which are contained in the catalog attached to Circular 23, shall be prepared and submitted to the competent tax authority after annual financial settlement completed every year. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law also provides that enterprises established outside of China whose &#8220;de facto management bodies&#8221; are located in China are considered &#8220;resident enterprises&#8221; and will generally be subject to the uniform 25% enterprise income tax rate on their global income. Although the term &#8220;de facto management bodies&#8221; is defined as &#8220;management bodies which has substantial and overall management and control power on the operation, human resources, accounting and assets of the enterprise,&#8221; the circumstances under which an enterprise&#8217;s &#8220;de facto management body&#8221; would be considered to be located in China are currently unclear. A circular issued by the State Administration of Taxation in April 2009 provides that a foreign enterprise controlled by a PRC company or a PRC company group will be classified as a &#8220;resident enterprise&#8221; with its &#8220;de facto management bodies&#8221; located within China if the following requirements are satisfied: (1)&#160;the senior management and core management departments in charge of its daily operations function mainly in the PRC; (2)&#160;its financial and human resources decisions are subject to determination or approval by persons or bodies in the PRC; (3)&#160;its major assets, accounting books, company seals, and minutes and files of its board and shareholders&#8217; meetings are located or kept in the PRC; and (4)&#160;at least half of the enterprise&#8217;s directors or senior management with voting rights reside in the PRC. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, the State Administration of Taxation issued a bulletin in August 2011, effective as of September&#160;1, 2011, to provide more guidance on the implementation of the above circular. The bulletin clarified certain matters relating to resident status determination, post determination administration and competent tax authorities. It also specifies that when provided with a copy of a PRC tax resident determination certificate from a resident <span style="white-space:nowrap">PRC-controlled</span> offshore incorporated enterprise, the payer should not withhold 10% income tax when paying the <span style="white-space:nowrap">PRC-sourced</span> dividends, interest and royalties to the <span style="white-space:nowrap">PRC-controlled</span> offshore incorporated enterprise. Although both the circular and the bulletin only apply to offshore enterprises controlled by PRC enterprises and not those by PRC individuals, the determination criteria set forth in the circular and administration clarification made in the bulletin may reflect the State Administration of Taxation&#8217;s general position on how the &#8220;de facto management body&#8221; test should be applied in determining the tax residency status of offshore enterprises and how the administration measures should be implemented, regardless of whether they are controlled by PRC enterprises or PRC individuals. </p>

From the year in which the entity is determined as a &#8220;resident enterprise,&#8221; any dividend, profit and other equity investment gain shall be taxed in accordance with the Article 26 of EIT law and the Article 17 and Article 83 of its implementation rules. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law provides that a maximum income tax rate of 20% may apply to dividends payable to <span style="white-space:nowrap">non-PRC</span> investors that are <span style="white-space:nowrap">&#8220;non-resident</span> enterprises,&#8221; to the extent such dividends are derived from sources within the PRC.

According to the Arrangement between Mainland China and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and Prevention of Fiscal Evasion, dividends paid to shareholders residing in Hong Kong are subject to a withholding tax of 5% provided that a Hong Kong resident enterprise owns over 25% of the PRC enterprise distributing the dividend and can be considered as a &#8220;beneficial owner&#8221; and entitled to treaty benefits under the DTA. In January 2018, the State Administration of Taxation promulgated Circular 9, to clarify the definition of beneficial owner under PRC tax treaties and tax arrangements. According to Circular 9, a beneficial owner refers to a party who holds ownership and control over incomes or the rights or assets from which the incomes are derived. In determining whether a resident of the other contracting party to a double taxation agreement, or a DTA, who is applying for enjoying preferential treatment under the DTA has the status as a beneficial owner, comprehensive analysis shall be conducted in light of the actual circumstances of the specific case and based on several factors, include among others, if (1)&#160;an applicant is under the obligation to pay 50% or more of the incomes received to any resident of any third country (region) within 12 months upon receipt of the incomes; and (2)&#160;if the business activities carried out by an applicant constitutes substantive business activities. Substantive business activities shall include substantive manufacturing, distribution, management and other activities. Whether an applicant&#8217;s business activities are substantive shall be determined based on the functions actually performed by the applicant and the risks assumed thereby. The substantive investment and shareholding management activities carried out by the applicant may constitute substantive business activities. Where the applicant concurrently engages in investment and shareholding management activities that do not constitute substantive business activities and other business activities, if the other business activities are not significant enough, the applicant will not be considered as engaging in substantive business activities and hence more likely not a beneficial owner. In addition, if the incomes derived by any of the following applicants from China are dividends, the relevant applicant may be directly determined as having the status of a &#8220;beneficial owner&#8221;: </p> <p style="font-size:6pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">&#160;</p>

Outbound investments for purpose of Circular 11 are the investment activities whereby an enterprise within PRC, directly or via overseas enterprises under its control, acquires ownership, controlling power, rights of operation and management and other relevant rights and interests overseas by making asset or equity investment, providing financing or guarantee, etc., and the aforementioned investment activities shall include but not limited to (1)&#160;acquiring land ownership, <span style="white-space:nowrap">land-use</span> rights and other rights and interests overseas; (2)&#160;acquiring concession rights to explore or exploit natural resources and other rights and interests overseas; (3)&#160;acquiring ownership, rights of operation and management and other rights and interests of infrastructure overseas; (4)&#160;acquiring ownership, rights of operation and management and other rights and interests of enterprises or assets overseas; (5)&#160;constructing new fixed assets overseas, or renovating or expanding existing fixed assets overseas; (6)&#160;establishing a new enterprise overseas or increasing investment in an existing enterprise overseas; (7)&#160;setting up a new overseas equity investment fund or purchasing units in an existing overseas equity investment fund; and (8)&#160;controlling enterprises or assets overseas by agreements or trusts.

 <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In January 2012, the ten former shareholders of New Oriental China completed the transfer of all of their equity interests in New Oriental China to Century Friendship, a PRC domestic enterprise controlled by Mr.&#160;Michael Minhong Yu, our founder and executive chairman, without consideration. Prior to the transfer, Century Friendship had held 53% of the equity interests in New Oriental China while the ten former shareholders of New Oriental China held the remaining equity interests. The purpose of the transfers was to further strengthen our corporate structure by simplifying the shareholding structure of New Oriental China. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Pursuant to the five equity pledge agreements dated April&#160;23, 2012 among New Oriental China, Century Friendship and five of our wholly-owned subsidiaries in China, namely Beijing Hewstone, Beijing Decision, Shanghai Smart Words, Beijing Pioneer and Beijing Smart Wood, Century Friendship agreed to pledge its equity interests in New Oriental China to these five subsidiaries to secure New Oriental China&#8217;s and its schools and subsidiaries&#8217; performance of their obligations under the relevant principal agreements, and Century Friendship has agreed not to transfer, sell, pledge, dispose of or otherwise create any encumbrance on its equity interests in New Oriental China without the prior written consents of our wholly-owned subsidiaries in China. Upon the conclusion of the master exclusive service agreement on September&#160;19, 2014 between Beijing Pioneer and New Oriental China, the list of principal agreements has been updated to include the master exclusive service agreement and the relevant service agreements. The equity pledges of Century Friendship under these equity pledge agreements have been registered with the Haidian District, Beijing branch of the State Administration for Market Regulation.

The rights and obligations of Shanghai Smart Words under these contractual arrangements have been assumed by Beijing Decision. The April 2012 equity pledge agreements have been amended to reflect the foregoing change while the other terms of these agreements remain unchanged. The equity pledges of Century Friendship under the amended agreements have been registered with the Haidian District, Beijing branch of the State Administration for Market Regulation. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><span style="font-weight:bold"><span style="font-style:italic">Exclusive Option Agreement</span></span>.

After the ten former shareholders of New Oriental China completed the transfer of all of their equity interests in New Oriental China to Century Friendship in early 2012, Century Friendship, as the sole shareholder of New Oriental China, executed a new option agreement with Shanghai Smart Words, one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries in China, and New Oriental China on April&#160;23, 2012, replacing previous exclusive option agreements. On February&#160;16, 2017, Beijing Decision entered into a new option agreement with Century Friendship and New Oriental China, replacing the previous option agreement dated April&#160;23, 2012. Pursuant to the current option agreement, Century Friendship is obligated to sell to Beijing Decision, and Beijing Decision has an exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional right to purchase from Century Friendship, in its sole discretion, part or of all of Century Friendship&#8217;s equity interests in New Oriental China when and to the extent that applicable PRC law permits it to own part or all of the equity interest in New Oriental China. In addition, Beijing Decision has an exclusive option to require Century Friendship to transfer all or part of Century Friendship&#8217;s equity interest in New Oriental China to another PRC person or entity designated by Beijing Decision at any time in its discretion. The purchase price to be paid by Beijing Decision will be the minimum amount of consideration permitted by applicable PRC law at the time when such share transfer occurs. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><span style="font-weight:bold"><span style="font-style:italic">Power of Attorney</span></span>. On December&#160;3, 2012, Century Friendship, in the capacity of the sole shareholder of New Oriental China, executed a proxy agreement and power of attorney with Beijing Pioneer, one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries in China, and New Oriental China, whereby Century Friendship irrevocably appoints and constitutes Beijing Pioneer as its <span style="white-space:nowrap"><span style="white-space:nowrap">attorney-in-fact</span></span> to exercise on Century Friendship&#8217;s behalf any and all rights that Century Friendship has in respect of its equity interests in New Oriental China. This proxy agreement and power of attorney became effective on December&#160;3, 2012 and replaces the powers of attorney executed by Century Friendship on April&#160;23, 2012. The proxy agreement and power of attorney will remain effective as long as New Oriental China exists.

Each service provider has the right to determine the fees associated with the services it provides based on factors such as the technical difficulty and complexity of the services and the actual labor costs it incurs for providing the services during the relevant period.

We expect that the demand for private educational services in China will be driven by (i)&#160;increasing disposable income per capita along with increasing level of urbanization, (ii)&#160;increasing education and employment opportunities requiring educational services beyond school curriculum, and (iii)&#160;advancement and wide application of innovative technology. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">However, any adverse changes in the economic conditions or regulatory environment in China may have a material adverse effect on the private education industry in China, which in turn may harm our business and results of operations and any heightened tension in international relations or global pandemic can have an adverse impact on our overseas related businesses, such as test preparation and consulting services. For example, on July&#160;24, 2021, the General Office of State Council and the General Office of Central Committee of the Communist Party of China jointly promulgated the Alleviating Burden Opinion, which provides, among others, that (i)&#160;Academic AST Institutions are prohibited from raising funds by listing on stock markets or conducting any capitalization activities; (ii)&#160;foreign capital is prohibited from controlling or participating in any Academic AST Institutions through mergers and acquisitions, entrusted operation, joining franchise or variable interest entities; (iii)&#160;online tutoring for <span style="white-space:nowrap">preschool-age</span> children is prohibited, and offline academic subjects (including foreign language) tutoring services for <span style="white-space:nowrap">preschool-age</span> children is also strictly prohibited. The Alleviating Burden Opinion provides that any violation of the foregoing shall be rectified. The Alleviating Burden Opinion further states that the administration and supervision over academic subjects tutoring institutions for students on grade ten to twelve shall be implemented by reference to the relevant provisions of the Alleviating Burden Opinion. See &#8220;Item 4. Information on the Company&#8212;B. Business Overview&#8212;Regulation&#8212;Regulations on Private Education&#8212;Regulations on After-School Tutoring&#8221; for more details. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In line with the development of our livestreaming <span style="white-space:nowrap">e-commerce</span> business, our results of operations are also affected by the general factors affecting the livestreaming <span style="white-space:nowrap">e-commerce</span> industry, including the level of overall economic growth, increase in per capita disposable income and growth in consumer spending, the growing popularity of online shopping, improvements in logistics infrastructure, among others. </p>

The demand for our courses also depends on the continued use of admissions and assessment tests by educational institutions and governmental authorities both in China and abroad. We determine course fees primarily based on demand for our courses, the targeted market for our courses, the subject of the course, the geographic location of the school, cost of services, and the course fees charged by our competitors for the same or similar courses. We typically adjust course fees or school fees based on the market conditions of the city where the particular school is located, subject to the relevant local governmental authority&#8217;s advance approval, if required. The level of our operating cost and expenses will depend on our ability to carry out our systemized and centralized approach to improve operational efficiency through refinement of our centralized operation platform that supports all service offerings and continued investment in technologies. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our future results of operations will depend significantly upon our ability to maintain and increase student enrollments both online and offline and offer a greater variety of courses, including those related to <span style="white-space:nowrap">non-academic</span> subjects. Our business changes may result in substantial demands on our management, operational, technological, financial and other resources. To manage and support our further development, we must improve our existing operational, administrative and technological systems and our financial and management controls, and recruit, train and retain additional qualified teachers and school management personnel as well as other administrative and sales and marketing personnel, particularly as we grow outside of our existing areas. We will continue to implement additional systems and measures and recruit qualified personnel in order to effectively manage and support our business. If we cannot achieve these improvements, our financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The results of operations of our livestreaming <span style="white-space:nowrap">e-commerce</span> business are more directly affected by certain company specific factors, including: our ability to attract and engage consumers and increase GMV on East Buy; our ability to develop high-quality and cost-effective private label products; our ability to enhance supply chain management capabilities, among others. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:bold"><span style="font-style:italic">Selected Statements of Operations Items </span></p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><span style="font-style:italic">Net Revenues</span>.

Under the Hong Kong tax law, our Hong Kong subsidiaries are exempted from the Hong Kong income tax on its foreign-derived income.

Our operating entities that provide educational services are subject to a simple value-added tax collection method and a 3% value-added tax rate since June 2016. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">With regard to income tax, enterprises in China are generally subject to enterprise income tax at a rate of 25%. Some of our subsidiaries and consolidated affiliated entities are entitled to a favorable statutory tax rate of 15% because of their qualifications as &#8220;High and New Technology Enterprises&#8221; or because of favorable local tax treatment. In addition, some of our subsidiaries and consolidated affiliated entities are entitled to an exemption from the enterprise income tax for two years beginning the enterprise&#8217;s first profitable year followed by a tax rate of 12.5% for the succeeding three years because of their qualifications as &#8220;Newly Established Software Enterprises.&#8221;<span style="font-weight:bold"><span style="font-style:italic"> </span></span> </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, under the current regulatory regime, whether our schools are entitled to any preferential income tax treatment remains unclear, and practice varies across different cities in China. Pursuant to the Implementation Rules for the Law for Promoting Private Education (2004), private schools that do not require reasonable returns enjoy the same preferential tax treatment as public schools, while the preferential tax treatment policies applicable to private schools requiring reasonable returns shall be separately formulated by the relevant authorities under the State Council. The Amended Private Education Law, which became effective on September&#160;1, 2017, no longer uses the term &#8220;reasonable return.&#8221; Instead, under the Amended Private Education Law, sponsors of private schools may choose to establish <span style="white-space:nowrap">non-profit</span> or <span style="white-space:nowrap">for-profit</span> private schools at their own discretion, except that private schools in compulsory education area can only be registered as <span style="white-space:nowrap">non-profit</span> private schools, and after-school tutoring institutions providing tutoring services on academic subjects can only be registered as <span style="white-space:nowrap">non-profit</span> private schools under the Alleviating Burden Opinion. Pursuant to the Amended Private Education Law, <span style="white-space:nowrap">non-profit</span> private schools will be entitled to the same tax benefits as public schools while taxation policies for <span style="white-space:nowrap">for-profit</span> private schools are still unclear. Due to a lack of implementation rules, whether our schools can be entitled to any preferential income tax treatment remains unclear. In practice, tax treatments for private schools vary across different cities in China. For example, private schools in certain cities are subject to a 25% standard enterprise income tax, while in other cities, private schools are subject to a fixed amount of enterprise income tax each year as determined by the local tax authority in lieu of the 25% standard enterprise income tax or are not required to pay enterprise income tax at all. Among our schools in four major cities from which we derived a significant portion of our revenues in the fiscal year ended May&#160;31, 2025, three schools are subject to the standard 25% enterprise income tax rate and one school was not required by the governing tax bureau to pay any enterprise income tax from its establishment through May&#160;31, 2025. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">For additional information on PRC regulations on taxation, see &#8220;Item 4.

 <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><span style="font-style:italic">Net Income. </span>As a result of the foregoing, our net income increased by 38.2% from US$235.4&#160;million in the fiscal year ended May&#160;31, 2023 to US$325.2&#160;million in the fiscal year ended May&#160;31, 2024. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:bold">Discussion of Segment Operations </p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">For the fiscal year ended May&#160;31, 2025, we identified four operating segments, including (i)&#160;educational services and test preparation courses, (ii)&#160;private label products and livestreaming <span style="white-space:nowrap">e-commerce,</span> (iii)&#160;overseas study consulting services, and (iv)&#160;educational materials and distribution. We identified educational services and test preparation courses, private label products and livestreaming <span style="white-space:nowrap">e-commerce</span> and overseas study consulting services as our three reportable segments for the fiscal year ended May&#160;31, 2025. Our operating segment, educational materials and distribution, individually did not exceed the 10% quantitative threshold during the fiscal year ended May&#160;31, 2025, and as a result, was aggregated in others. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Net revenues from our educational services and test preparation courses accounted for 63.9%, 63.0% and 70.5%, respectively, of our total net revenues in the fiscal years ended May&#160;31, 2023, 2024 and 2025. Net revenues from private label products and livestreaming <span style="white-space:nowrap">e-commerce</span> accounted for 18.6%, 20.9% and 12.2%, respectively, of our total net revenues in the fiscal years ended May&#160;31, 2023, 2024 and 2025. Net revenues from overseas study consulting services accounted for 11.8%, 10.2% and 10.5%, respectively, of our total net revenues in the fiscal years ended May&#160;31, 2023, 2024 and 2025. We recognize revenues from course fees collected for enrollment in our educational services and test preparation courses and online education proportionally as we deliver the instruction over the period of the course. We recognize revenues from the sales of private label products when control of the promised goods is transferred to the customer. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Cost of revenues for our educational services and test preparation courses primarily consists of teaching fees and performance-linked bonuses paid to our teachers, rental payments for our schools and learning centers and, to a lesser degree, depreciation and amortization of property and equipment used in the provision of educational services. Cost of revenues for our private label products and livestreaming <span style="white-space:nowrap">e-commerce</span> business primarily consists of labor cost and procurement cost of goods. Cost of overseas study consulting services primarily consists of application cost and staff costs. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Selling and marketing expenses for each of our reportable segments primarily consist of marketing and promotion expenses and other costs related to our selling and marketing activities for the corresponding reportable segment. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">General and administrative expenses for each of our reportable segments primarily consist of compensation and benefits of administrative staff of our reportable segments, compensation and benefits, rental and utilities payments relating to office and administrative functions of our reportable segments, depreciation and amortization of property and equipment used in the general and administrative activities of our reportable segments and, to a lesser extent, costs to develop our curriculum.<span style="font-weight:bold"><span style="font-style:italic"> </span></span> </p>

In the fiscal years ended May&#160;31, 2023, 2024 and 2025, the consolidated affiliated entities contributed in aggregate 99.5%, 99.2% and 99.8%, respectively, of our total net revenues. Our operations not conducted through contractual arrangements with the variable interest entities primarily consist of the leasing of our commercial property. As of May&#160;31, 2024 and 2025, the consolidated affiliated entities accounted for an aggregate of 62.2% and 68.7%, respectively, of our total assets, and 96.7% and 97.2%, respectively, of our total liabilities. The assets not associated with the consolidated affiliated entities primarily consist of cash and cash equivalents, term deposits and short-term investments.

The amount of dividends paid by our PRC subsidiaries to us primarily depends on the service fees paid to our PRC subsidiaries from the variable interest entities, and, to a lesser degree, our PRC subsidiaries&#8217; retained earnings. As of May&#160;31, 2023, 2024 and 2025, the total amount of service fees payable to our PRC subsidiaries from the variable interest entities under the service agreements was US$61.8&#160;million, US$309.1&#160;million and US$393.5&#160;million, respectively. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Conducting our operations through contractual arrangements with the variable interest entities entails a risk that we may lose the power to direct the activities that most significantly affect the economic performance of the variable interest entities, which may result in our being unable to consolidate their financial results with our results and may impair our access to their cash flow from operations and thereby reduce our liquidity.

Although the statutory reserves can be used, among other ways, to increase the registered capital and eliminate future losses in excess of retained earnings of the respective companies, the reserve funds are not distributable as cash dividends except in the event of liquidation. In addition, each of our schools that requires or does not requires reasonable returns in China is required to allocate a certain amount out of its annual net income or annual increase in the net assets, if any, to its development fund for the construction or maintenance of the school or procurement or upgrade of educational equipment. For our schools which have elected to require reasonable returns, this amount shall be no less than 25% of the annual net income of the school, and for our schools which have elected not to require reasonable returns, this amount shall be equivalent to no less than 25% of the annual increase in the net assets of the school, if any. Each of our schools that is <span style="white-space:nowrap">for-profit</span> or <span style="white-space:nowrap">non-profit</span> in China is required to allocate a certain amount to its development fund for the development of the school. In the case of a <span style="white-space:nowrap">for-profit</span> private school, this amount shall be no less than 10% of the audited annual net income of the school, while in the case of a <span style="white-space:nowrap">non-profit</span> private school, this amount shall be equal to no less than 10% of the audited annual increase in the unrestricted net assets of the school, if any. Upon the effectiveness of the Amended Law for Promoting Private Education in September 2017, sponsors of <span style="white-space:nowrap">for-profit</span> private schools are entitled to retain the profits and proceeds from the schools and the operation surplus may be allocated to the sponsors pursuant to the PRC Company Law and other relevant laws and regulations.

After paying the applicable withholding taxes and making appropriations for its statutory reserve requirement, the remaining net profits of our PRC subsidiaries would be available for distribution to three Hong Kong-incorporated intermediate holding companies wholly owned by our company, and from these three Hong Kong-incorporated intermediate holding companies to our company. See &#8220;Item 4. Information on the Company&#8212;C. Organizational Structure&#8221; for a diagram of our corporate structure. As of May&#160;31, 2025, the net assets of our PRC subsidiaries and variable interest entities and their schools and subsidiaries which were restricted due to statutory reserve requirements and other applicable laws and regulations, and thus not available for distribution, were in aggregate US$973.3&#160;million, and the net assets of our PRC subsidiaries and variable interest entities and their schools and subsidiaries which were unrestricted and thus available for distribution were in aggregate US$1,869.0&#160;million. We do not believe that these restrictions on the distribution of our net assets will have a significant impact on our ability to timely meet our financial obligations in the future.

We continually evaluate these estimates and assumptions based on the most recently available information, our own historical experiences and other factors that we believe to be relevant under the circumstances. Our management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of these estimates with our board of directors.

We consider the policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our audited consolidated financial statements because they involve the greatest reliance on our management&#8217;s judgment.

We may also terminate an executive officer&#8217;s employment without cause. In such case we are required to provide severance compensations as expressly required by applicable law. An executive officer may terminate his employment with us at any time with a <span style="white-space:nowrap">one-month</span> prior notice if there is a material reduction in his authority, duties and responsibilities or if there is a material reduction in his annual salary before the next annual salary review. An executive officer may also resign prior to the expiry of the term of his employment agreement if our board approves his resignation or agrees to an alternative arrangement with such executive officer. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Each executive officer has agreed to hold, both during and after the termination or expiry of his employment agreement, in strict confidence and not to use, except as required in the performance of his duties in connection with the employment, any of our confidential information or trade secrets, any confidential information or trade secrets of our clients or prospective clients, or the confidential or proprietary information of any third party received by us and for which we have confidential obligations. Our executive officers have also agreed to disclose in confidence to us all inventions, designs and trade secrets which they conceive, develop or reduce to practice and to assign all right, title and interest in them to us, and assist us in obtaining patents, copyrights and other legal rights for these inventions, designs and trade secrets. In addition, each executive officer has agreed to be bound by <span style="white-space:nowrap">non-competition</span> and <span style="white-space:nowrap">non-solicitation</span> restrictions during the term of his employment and one year following the termination or expiry of such employment agreement. Specifically, each executive officer has agreed not to (1)&#160;approach our clients, customers or contacts or other persons or entities introduced to the executive officer for the purpose of doing business with such person or entities that will harm our business relationships with these persons or entities; (2)&#160;assume employment with or provide services as a director for any of our competitors, or engage, whether as principal, partner, licensor or otherwise, in any business which is in direct or indirect competition with our business or (3)&#160;seek directly or indirectly, to solicit the services of any of our employees who is employed by us on or after the date of the executive officer&#8217;s termination, or in the year preceding such termination. </p> <p style="font-size:18pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">&#160;</p>

Pursuant to the exception granted to foreign private issuers under Section&#160;303A.00 of the NYSE Listed Company Manual, we have elected to follow our home country practice with respect to our board of directors. A director is not required to hold any shares in the company by way of qualification. A director may vote with respect to any contract, proposed contract or arrangement in which he is materially interested. A director may exercise all the powers of the company to borrow money, mortgage its undertaking, property and uncalled capital, and issue debentures or other securities whenever money is borrowed or as security for any obligation of the company or of any third party. Our independent directors hold executive sessions, during which only the independent directors are present, at least once a year. Depending on the nature of the discussion at an executive session, each of the three independent directors may preside at the executive sessions. In the fiscal year ended May&#160;31, 2025, our board held meetings or passed resolutions by unanimous written consent 16 times. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:bold">Committees of the Board of Directors </p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have established three fully independent committees under the board of directors: the audit committee, the compensation committee and the nominating and corporate governance committee.

In March 2012, Fine Talent Holdings Limited, a British Virgin Islands company wholly-owned by Mr.&#160;Michael Minhong Yu, our executive chairman, purchased all of the equity interests in Metropolis Holding from its former owner which was and is unrelated to us. As a result, our lease agreements with Metropolis Holding became related parties transactions. As of May&#160;31, 2025, 38 of our operating entities rented office space from Metropolis Holding pursuant to a series of lease agreements. The terms and conditions, including rental rates, of these lease agreements are generally the same as other tenants in the same building. These lease agreements are typically two to five years and can be renewed upon mutual agreements upon expiration. The lease arrangements were approved by all of our directors, including all of the disinterested directors. During the fiscal year ended May&#160;31, 2025, we accrued a total of US$13.2&#160;million rent to Metropolis Holding. As of May&#160;31, 2025, amounts due from Metropolis Holding were US$5.2&#160;million, which represented prepaid rent and rental deposit. In addition, Metropolis Holding, as a property management company, also provided property management services to the Company for several rented floors of office space. As of May&#160;31, 2025, amounts due to Metropolis Holding were US$0.4&#160;million, which represented accrued but unpaid service fee. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:bold">Loans to a Related Party </p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Thaiwoo Enterprise Management Company Limited is an equity method investee of us.

A beneficial owner is defined as an individual who (a)&#160;ultimately owns or controls, whether through direct or indirect ownership or control, 25% or more of the shares, voting rights, or partnership interests in the entity, (b)&#160;otherwise exercises ultimate effective control over the management of the entity, or (c)&#160;is identified as exercising control of the entity through other means. The beneficial ownership register is not a public document and is only accessible by a designated competent authority of the Cayman Islands, except where the Cayman Islands government does provide for access by members of the public under the Beneficial Ownership Transparency (Legitimate Interest Access) Regulations (As Revised) of the Cayman Islands, save as such access may be restricted pursuant to the Beneficial Ownership Transparency (Access Restriction) Regulations (As Revised) of the Cayman Islands. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As we are listed on the NYSE (an approved stock exchange under the Beneficial Ownership Regime), we may adopt an alternative route to compliance with the Beneficial Ownership Regime by providing our corporate services provider with written confirmation that we are listed on the NYSE and its jurisdiction. Accordingly, as long as we are listed on the NYSE, we intend to make arrangements to provide our corporate services provider with written confirmation that we are listed on the NYSE and its jurisdiction and adopt this alternative route to compliance rather than maintaining a beneficial ownership register. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:bold">Anti-money&#160;Laundering &#8211; Cayman Islands </p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In order to comply with legislation or regulations aimed at the prevention of money laundering, we may be required to adopt and maintain anti-money laundering procedures, and may require subscribers to provide evidence to verify their identity. Where permitted, and subject to certain conditions, we may also delegate the maintenance of our anti-money laundering procedures (including the acquisition of due diligence information) to a suitable person. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We reserve the right to request such information as is necessary to verify the identity of a subscriber.

 <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:bold">Differences in Corporate Law </p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Companies Act is derived, to a large extent, from the older Companies Acts of England but does not follow recent statutory enactments in England. In addition, the Companies Act differs from laws applicable to United States corporations and their shareholders. Set forth below is a summary of the significant differences between the provisions of the Companies Act applicable to us and the laws applicable to companies incorporated in the United States. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><span style="font-style:italic">Mergers and Similar Arrangements</span>. The Companies Act permits mergers and consolidations between Cayman Islands companies and between Cayman Islands companies and <span style="white-space:nowrap">non-Cayman</span> Islands companies. For these purposes, (a) &#8220;merger&#8221; means the merging of two or more constituent companies and the vesting of their undertaking, property and liabilities in one of such companies as the surviving company and (b)&#160;a &#8220;consolidation&#8221; means the combination of two or more constituent companies into a combined company and the vesting of the undertaking, property and liabilities of such companies to the consolidated company. In order to effect such a merger or consolidation, the directors of each constituent company must approve a written plan of merger or consolidation, which must then be authorized by (a)&#160;a special resolution of the shareholders of each constituent company, and (b)&#160;such other authorization, if any, as may be specified in such constituent company&#8217;s articles of association. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The written plan of merger or consolidation must be filed with the Registrar of Companies together with a declaration as to the solvency of the consolidated or surviving company, a list of the assets and liabilities of each constituent company and an undertaking that a copy of the certificate of merger or consolidation will be given to the members and creditors of each constituent company and that notification of the merger or consolidation will be published in the Cayman Islands Gazette. Dissenting shareholders have the right to be paid the fair value of their shares (which, if not agreed between the parties, will be determined by the Cayman Islands court) if they follow the required procedures, subject to certain exceptions. Court approval is not required for a merger or consolidation which is effected in compliance with these statutory procedures. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, there are statutory provisions that facilitate the reconstruction and amalgamation of companies, provided that the arrangement is approved by a majority in number of each class of shareholders and creditors with whom the arrangement is to be made, and who must, in addition, represent 75% in value of each such class of shareholders or creditors, as the case may be, that are present and voting either in person or by proxy at a meeting, or meetings, convened for that purpose. The convening of the meetings and subsequently the arrangement must be sanctioned by the Grand Court of the Cayman Islands. While a dissenting shareholder has the right to express to the court the view that the transaction ought not to be approved, the Grand Court of the Cayman Islands can be expected to approve the arrangement if it determines that (a)&#160;the statutory provisions as to the required majority vote have been met; (b)&#160;the shareholders have been fairly represented at the meeting in question and the statutory majority are acting bona fide without coercion of the minority to promote interests adverse to those of the class; (c)&#160;the arrangement is such that may be reasonably approved by an intelligent and honest man of that class acting in respect of his interest; and (d)&#160;the arrangement is not one that would more properly be sanctioned under some other provision of the Companies Act. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If an arrangement and reconstruction is thus approved, the dissenting shareholder would have no rights comparable to appraisal rights, which would otherwise ordinarily be available to dissenting shareholders of Delaware corporations, providing rights to receive payment in cash for the judicially determined value of the shares. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">When a takeover offer is made and accepted by holders of 90% of the shares affected within four months, the offeror may, within a <span style="white-space:nowrap">two-month</span> period commencing on the expiration of such four month period, require the holders of the remaining shares to transfer such shares on the terms of the offer. An objection can be made to the Grand Court of the Cayman Islands but this is unlikely to succeed in the case of an offer which has been so approved unless there is evidence of fraud, bad faith or collusion. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><span style="font-style:italic">Shareholders&#8217; Suits</span>. In principle, we will normally be the proper plaintiff and as a general rule a derivative action may not be brought by a minority shareholder. However, based on English authorities, which would in all likelihood be of persuasive authority in the Cayman Islands, there are exceptions to the foregoing principle, including when (a)&#160;a company acts or proposes to act illegally or ultra vires; (b)&#160;the act complained of, although not ultra vires, could only be effected duly if authorized by more than a simple majority vote that has not been obtained; and (c)&#160;those who control the company are perpetrating a &#8220;fraud on the minority.&#8221; </p>
 <p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt ; font-size:8pt">&#160;</p> <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman;text-align:center">148 </p>

 <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><span style="font-style:italic">Indemnification of Directors and Executive Officers and Limitation of Liability</span>. Cayman Islands law does not limit the extent to which a company&#8217;s articles of association may provide for indemnification of officers and directors, except to the extent any such provision may be held by the Cayman Islands courts to be contrary to public policy, such as to provide indemnification against civil fraud or the consequences of committing a crime. Our third amended and restated memorandum and articles of association permit indemnification of officers and directors for losses, damages, costs and expenses incurred in their capacities as such unless such losses or damages arise from dishonesty or fraud which may attach to such directors or officers. This standard of conduct is generally the same as permitted under the Delaware General Corporation Law for a Delaware corporation. In addition, we intend to enter into indemnification agreements with our directors and senior executive officers that will provide such persons with additional indemnification beyond that provided in our third amended and restated memorandum and articles of association. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to our directors, officers or persons controlling us under the foregoing provisions, we have been informed that, in the opinion of the SEC, such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is therefore unenforceable. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><span style="font-style:italic">Anti-Takeover Provisions in the Memorandum and Articles of Association</span>. Some provisions of our third amended and restated memorandum and articles of association may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company or management that shareholders may consider favorable, including provisions that authorize our board of directors to issue preference shares in one or more series and to designate the price, rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of such preference shares without any further vote or action by our shareholders. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">However, under Cayman Islands law, our directors may only exercise the rights and powers granted to them under our third amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, as amended and restated from time to time, for what they believe in good faith to be in the best interests of our company. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><span style="font-style:italic">Directors&#8217; Fiduciary Duties</span>. As a matter of Cayman Islands law, a director of a Cayman Islands company is in the position of a fiduciary with respect to the company and therefore it is considered that he owes the following duties to the company&#8212;a duty to act bona fide in the best interests of the company, a duty not to make a profit based on his or her position as director (unless the company permits him to do so) and a duty not to put himself in a position where the interests of the company conflict with his or her personal interest or his or her duty to a third party. A director of a Cayman Islands company owes to the company a duty to act with skill and care. It was previously considered that a director need not exhibit in the performance of his or her duties a greater degree of skill than may reasonably be expected from a person of his or her knowledge and experience. However, English and Commonwealth courts have moved towards an objective standard with regard to the required skill and care and these authorities are likely to be followed in the Cayman Islands. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, directors of a Cayman Islands company must not place themselves in a position in which there is a conflict between their duty to the company and their personal interests. However, this obligation may be varied by the company&#8217;s articles of association, which may permit a director to vote on a matter in which he has a personal interest provided that he has disclosed that nature of his interest to the board. Our third amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provides that a director with an interest (direct or indirect) in a contract or arrangement or proposed contract or arrangement with the company must declare the nature of his interest at the meeting of the board of directors at which the question of entering into the contract or arrangement is first considered, if he knows his interest then exists, or in any other case at the first meeting of the board of directors after he is or has become so interested. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">A general notice may be given at a meeting of the board of directors to the effect that (i)&#160;the director is a member/officer of a specified company or firm and is to be regarded as interested in any contract or arrangement which may after the date of the notice in writing be made with that company or firm; or (ii)&#160;he is to be regarded as interested in any contract or arrangement which may after the date of the notice in writing to the board of directors be made with a specified person who is connected with him, will be deemed sufficient declaration of interest. Following the disclosure being made pursuant to our third amended and restated memorandum and articles of association and subject to any separate requirement for Audit Committee approval under applicable law or the listing rules of the NYSE, and unless disqualified by the chairman of the relevant board meeting, a director may vote in respect of any contract or arrangement in which such director is interested and may be counted in the quorum at such meeting. However, even if a director discloses his interest and is therefore permitted to vote, he must still comply with his duty to act bona fide in the best interest of our company. </p>

<div style="text-align:center"><div style="width:8.5in;text-align:left;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto">
 <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In comparison, under Delaware corporate law, a director of a Delaware corporation has a fiduciary duty to the corporation and its shareholders. This duty has two components: the duty of care and the duty of loyalty. The duty of care requires that a director act in good faith, with the care that an ordinarily prudent person would exercise under similar circumstances. Under this duty, a director must inform himself of, and disclose to shareholders, all material information reasonably available regarding a significant transaction. The duty of loyalty requires that a director act in a manner he or she reasonably believes to be in the best interests of the corporation. He or she must not use his or her corporate position for personal gain or advantage. This duty prohibits self-dealing by a director and mandates that the best interest of the corporation and its shareholders take precedence over any interest possessed by a director, officer or controlling shareholder and not shared by the shareholders generally. In general, actions of a director are presumed to have been made on an informed basis, in good faith and in the honest belief that the action taken was in the best interests of the corporation. However, this presumption may be rebutted by evidence of a breach of one of the fiduciary duties. Should such evidence be presented concerning a transaction by a director, a director must prove the procedural fairness of the transaction, and that the transaction was of fair value to the corporation. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><span style="font-style:italic">Shareholder Proposals</span>. Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, a shareholder has the right to put any proposal before the annual meeting of shareholders, provided that it complies with the notice provisions in the governing documents. A special meeting may be called by the board of directors or any other person authorized to do so in the governing documents, but shareholders may be precluded from calling special meetings. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">There are no statutory requirements under Cayman Islands law allowing our shareholders to requisition a shareholders&#8217; meeting. However, under our third amended and restated articles of association, on the requisition of shareholders representing not less than 33% of the voting rights entitled to vote at general meetings, the board shall convene an extraordinary general meeting. As an exempted Cayman Islands company, we are not obliged by law to call shareholders&#8217; annual general meetings, and our third amended and restated articles of association do not require us to call such meetings every year. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><span style="font-style:italic">Cumulative Voting</span>. Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, cumulative voting for elections of directors is not permitted unless the corporation&#8217;s certificate of incorporation specifically provides for it. Cumulative voting potentially facilitates the representation of minority shareholders on a board of directors since it permits the minority shareholder to cast all the votes to which the shareholder is entitled on a single director, which increases the shareholder&#8217;s voting power with respect to electing such director. As permitted under Cayman Islands law, our third amended and restated articles of association do not provide for cumulative voting. As a result, our shareholders are not afforded any less protections or rights on this issue than shareholders of a Delaware corporation. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><span style="font-style:italic">Removal of Directors</span>. Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, a director of a corporation with a classified board may be removed only for cause with the approval of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote, unless the certificate of incorporation provides otherwise. Under our third amended and restated articles of association, directors may be removed by an ordinary resolution of shareholders. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><span style="font-style:italic">Transactions with Interested Shareholders</span>. The Delaware General Corporation Law contains a business combination statute applicable to Delaware corporations whereby, unless the corporation has specifically elected not to be governed by such statute by amendment to its certificate of incorporation, it is prohibited from engaging in certain business combinations with an &#8220;interested shareholder&#8221; for three years following the date that such person becomes an interested shareholder. An interested shareholder generally is a person or a group who or which owns or owned 15% or more of the target&#8217;s outstanding voting share within the past three years. This has the effect of limiting the ability of a potential acquirer to make a <span style="white-space:nowrap">two-tiered</span> bid for the target in which all shareholders would not be treated equally. The statute does not apply if, among other things, prior to the date on which such shareholder becomes an interested shareholder, the board of directors approves either the business combination or the transaction which resulted in the person becoming an interested shareholder. This encourages any potential acquirer of a Delaware corporation to negotiate the terms of any acquisition transaction with the target&#8217;s board of directors. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><span style="font-style:italic">Cayman Islands law has no comparable statute</span>. As a result, we cannot avail ourselves of the types of protections afforded by the Delaware business combination statute. However, although Cayman Islands law does not regulate transactions between a company and its significant shareholders, it does provide that such transactions must be entered into bona fide in the best interests of the company and for a proper corporate purpose and not with the effect of constituting a fraud on the minority shareholders. </p>

Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, unless the board of directors approves the proposal to dissolve, dissolution must be approved by shareholders holding 100% of the total voting power of the corporation. Only if the dissolution is initiated by the board of directors may it be approved by a simple majority of the corporation&#8217;s outstanding shares. Delaware law allows a Delaware corporation to include in its certificate of incorporation a supermajority voting requirement in connection with dissolutions initiated by the board. Under Cayman Islands law, a company may be wound up by either an order of the courts of the Cayman Islands or by a special resolution of its members or, if the company is unable to pay its debts as they fall due, by an ordinary resolution of its members.

There are no other taxes likely to be material to the holders of our ADSs or common shares levied by the government of the Cayman Islands except for stamp duties which may be applicable on instruments executed in, or brought within the jurisdiction of the Cayman Islands. The Cayman Islands is a party to a double tax treaty entered into with the United Kingdom in 2010 but otherwise is not party to any double tax treaties. There are no exchange control regulations or currency restrictions in the Cayman Islands. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:bold">PRC Taxation </p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Under the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law, an enterprise established outside the PRC with &#8220;de facto management body&#8221; within the PRC is considered as a &#8220;resident enterprise,&#8221; meaning that it can be treated in a manner similar to a PRC enterprise for enterprise income tax purposes, although the dividends paid to one resident enterprise from another may qualify as <span style="white-space:nowrap">&#8220;tax-exempt</span> income.&#8221; The implementation rules of the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law define de facto management as &#8220;substantial and overall management and control over the production and operations, personnel, accounting, and properties&#8221; of the enterprise. The State Administration of Taxation has issued circular to provide that a foreign enterprise controlled by a PRC company or a PRC company group will be classified as a &#8220;resident enterprise&#8221; with its &#8220;de facto management body&#8221; located within China if all of the following requirements are satisfied: (i)&#160;the senior management and core management departments in charge of its daily operations function are mainly in the PRC; (ii)&#160;its financial and human resources decisions are subject to determination or approval by persons or bodies in the PRC; (iii)&#160;its major assets, accounting books, company seals, and minutes and files of its board and shareholders&#8217; meetings are located or kept in the PRC; and (iv)&#160;at least half of the enterprise&#8217;s directors with voting right or senior management reside in the PRC. In addition, the State Administration of Taxation issued a bulletin on August&#160;3, 2011, effective as of September&#160;1, 2011, to provide more guidance on the implementation of the above circular. The bulletin clarified certain matters relating to resident status determination, post-determination administration and competent tax authorities. It also specifies that when provided with a copy of a PRC tax resident determination certificate from a resident <span style="white-space:nowrap">PRC-controlled</span> offshore incorporated enterprise, the payer should not withhold 10% income tax when paying the <span style="white-space:nowrap">PRC-sourced</span> dividends, interest and royalties to the <span style="white-space:nowrap">PRC-controlled</span> offshore incorporated enterprise. Although both the circular and the bulletin only apply to offshore enterprises controlled by PRC enterprises and not those by PRC individuals, the determination criteria set forth in the circular and administration clarification made in the bulletin may reflect the State Administration of Taxation&#8217;s general position on how the &#8220;de facto management body&#8221; test should be applied in determining the tax residency status of offshore enterprises and the administration measures should be implemented, regardless of whether they are controlled by PRC enterprises or PRC individuals. In addition, the State Administration of Taxation issued a bulletin on January&#160;29, 2014, to provide more guidance on the implementation of the above circular. This bulletin further provided that, among other things, an entity that is classified as a &#8220;resident enterprise&#8221; in accordance with the circular shall file the application for classifying its status of residential enterprise with the local tax authorities where its main domestic investors registered. From the year in which the entity is determined as a &#8220;resident enterprise,&#8221; any dividend, profit and other equity investment gain shall be taxed in accordance with the Article 26 of EIT law and the Article 17 and Article 83 of its implementation rules. If we are deemed to be a PRC resident enterprise, dividends distributed to our <span style="white-space:nowrap">non-PRC</span> enterprise shareholders by us, or the gain our <span style="white-space:nowrap">non-PRC</span> enterprise shareholders may realize from the transfer of our common shares or ADSs, may be treated as <span style="white-space:nowrap">PRC-sourced</span> income and therefore be subject to a 10% PRC withholding tax pursuant to the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">For more information on PRC taxation applicable to our company, see &#8220;Item 4.

The remainder of this discussion assumes that a U.S. Holder of our ADSs will be treated in this manner. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:bold"><span style="font-style:italic">Passive Foreign Investment Company Considerations </span></p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">A <span style="white-space:nowrap">non-United</span> States corporation, such as our company, will be a &#8220;passive foreign investment company,&#8221; or a &#8220;PFIC,&#8221; for United States federal income tax purposes, if either (1) 75% or more of its gross income for such year consists of certain types of &#8220;passive&#8221; income or (2) 50% or more of the value of its assets (generally determined on the basis of a quarterly average) during such year is attributable to assets that produce passive income or are held for the production of passive income. For this purpose, cash and assets readily convertible into cash are categorized as passive assets and the company&#8217;s goodwill and other unbooked intangibles associated with active business activities may generally be classified as active assets. Passive income generally includes, among other things, dividends, interest, rents, royalties, and gains from the disposition of passive assets. If a <span style="white-space:nowrap">non-U.S.</span> corporation directly or indirectly owns at least 25% (by value) of the stock of another corporation, such corporation will be treated, for purposes of the PFIC tests, as owning a proportionate share of the assets and earning a proportionate share of the other corporation&#8217;s assets and receiving a proportionate share of the other corporation&#8217;s income. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Although the law in this regard is unclear, we treat the VIES (including their subsidiaries) as being owned by us for U.S. federal income tax purposes, not only because we exercise effective control over the operation of such entities but also because we are entitled to substantially all of the economic benefits associated with these entities, and, as a result, we are considered the primary beneficiary of these entities and consolidate their operating results in our combined financial statements under the U.S. GAAP for accounting purposes. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Based upon the nature and composition of our assets (in particular, the retention of substantial amounts of cash, deposits and investments), and the market price of our ADSs, we believe that we were a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes for the taxable year ended May&#160;31, 2025, and we will likely be a PFIC for our current taxable year unless the market price of our ADSs increases and/or we invest a substantial amount of the cash and other passive assets we hold in assets that produce or are held for the production of active income. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:bold"><span style="font-style:italic">Taxation of Distributions on the ADSs or Common Shares </span></p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Subject to the passive foreign investment company rules discussed below, the gross amount of all our distributions (including the amount of any tax withheld) paid to a U.S. Holder with respect to the ADSs or common shares out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined under U.S. federal income tax principles, will generally be included in gross income as ordinary dividend income on the date actually or constructively received by the depositary, in the case of ADSs, or by the U.S. Holder, in the case of common shares. Because we do not intend to determine our earnings and profits on the basis of U.S. federal income tax principles, any distribution paid will generally be reported as a &#8220;dividend&#8221; for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The dividends will not be eligible for the dividends-received deduction allowed to corporations in respect of dividends received from other U.S. corporations. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">With respect to <span style="white-space:nowrap">non-corporate</span> U.S. Holders, including individuals, dividends may be &#8220;qualified dividend income&#8221; which is taxed at the lower applicable capital gains rate provided that (1)&#160;the ADSs or common shares, as applicable, are readily tradable on an established securities market in the United States, or we are eligible for the benefit of the income tax treaty between the U.S. and the PRC (the &#8220;Treaty&#8221;), (2) the <span style="white-space:nowrap">non-United</span> States corporation is not a passive foreign investment company for either its taxable year in which the dividend was paid or the preceding taxable year and (3)&#160;certain holding period requirements are met. Although we expect our ADSs will be considered to be readily tradable on the NYSE, which is an established securities market in the U.S., there can be no assurance that our ADSs will be considered readily tradable on an established securities market in the future. Since we do not expect that our common shares will be listed on an established securities market in the U.S., it is unclear whether dividends that we pay on our common shares that are not backed by ADSs currently meet the conditions required for the reduced tax rate. </p>

In the event that we are deemed to be a PRC resident enterprise under the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law, a U.S. Holder may be subject to PRC withholding taxes on dividends paid on our ADSs or common shares. A U.S. Holder may be subject to a number of complex limitations, to claim a foreign tax credit in respect of any foreign withholding taxes imposed on dividends received on our ADSs or common shares.

The gain or loss will generally be capital gain or loss. A <span style="white-space:nowrap">non-corporate</span> U.S. Holder, including an individual, who has held the ADS or common share for more than one year will be eligible for reduced capital gains rates. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.

Pursuant to U.S. Treasury regulations (the applicability of which has been postponed until further guidance is issued), however, if a U.S. Holder is not eligible for the benefits of the Treaty or does not elect to apply the Treaty, then such holder may not be able to claim a foreign tax credit arising from any PRC tax imposed on the disposition of the ADSs or common shares. The rules regarding foreign tax credits and deduction of foreign taxes are complex. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the tax consequences if a foreign tax is imposed on a disposition of our ADSs or common shares, including the availability of a foreign tax credit or deduction in light of their particular circumstances, including their eligibility for benefits under the Treaty, and the potential impact of the U.S. Treasury regulations. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As discussed above, we believe that we were a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes for our taxable year ended May&#160;31, 2025.

 <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The <span style="white-space:nowrap"><span style="white-space:nowrap">mark-to-market</span></span> election is available only for &#8220;marketable stock,&#8221; which is stock that is traded in other than de minimis quantities on at least 15 days during each calendar quarter (&#8220;regularly traded&#8221;) on a qualified exchange or other market, as defined in applicable United States Treasury regulations. Our ADSs are listed on the NYSE, which is a qualified exchange or market for these purposes. Consequently, if the ADSs continue to be listed on the NYSE and are regularly traded, and a U.S. Holder holds ADSs, we expect that the <span style="white-space:nowrap"><span style="white-space:nowrap">mark-to-market</span></span> election would be available to such U.S. Holder if we are a PFIC. However, there can be no assurance in this regard. Only our ADSs, and not our common shares, are listed on the NYSE. Consequently, if a U.S. Holder holds common shares that are not represented by ADSs, such holder generally will not be eligible to make a <span style="white-space:nowrap"><span style="white-space:nowrap">mark-to-market</span></span> election if we are a PFIC. Because a <span style="white-space:nowrap"><span style="white-space:nowrap">mark-to-market</span></span> election cannot technically be made for equity interests in any lower-tier PFICs that we own, a U.S. Holder may continue to be subject to the PFIC rules with respect to its indirect interest in any investments held by us that are treated as an equity interest in a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In the case of a U.S. Holder who has held ADSs or common shares during any taxable year in respect of which we were classified as a PFIC and continues to hold such ADSs or common shares (or any portion thereof) and has not previously determined to make a <span style="white-space:nowrap"><span style="white-space:nowrap">mark-to-market</span></span> election, and who is now considering making a <span style="white-space:nowrap"><span style="white-space:nowrap">mark-to-market</span></span> election, special tax rules may apply relating to purging the PFIC taint of such ADSs or common shares. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We do not intend to provide information necessary for U.S. Holders to make qualified electing fund elections which, if available, would result in tax treatment different from (and generally less adverse than) the general tax treatment for PFICs described above. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If a U.S. Holder holds ADSs or common shares in any year in which we are treated as a PFIC with respect to such U.S. Holder, the U.S. Holder will generally be required to file United States Internal Revenue Service Form 8621 and such other form as is required by the United States Treasury Department. U.S. Holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the potential reporting requirements that may apply and the U.S. federal income tax consequences of holding and disposing of our ADSs or common shares if we are treated as a PFIC, including the possibility of making a <span style="white-space:nowrap"><span style="white-space:nowrap">mark-to-market</span></span> election and the unavailability of the election to treat us as a qualified electing fund. </p> <p style="font-size:18pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">&#160;</p>

We have not been exposed, nor do we anticipate being exposed, to material risks due to changes in interest rates. However, our future interest income may be lower than expected due to changes in market interest rates.

We are a Cayman Islands company, and our chief executive officer is not required under applicable Cayman Islands law to make such a certification. Pursuant to the exception granted to foreign private issuers under Section&#160;303A.00 of the NYSE Listed Company Manual, we have followed our home country practice in this regard and have not in the past submitted the certification set forth in Section&#160;303A.12(a) of the NYSE Listed Company Manual. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Section&#160;303A.01 of the NYSE Listed Company Manual requires each listed company to have a majority of independent directors on the board of directors after the first anniversary of the company&#8217;s listing on the NYSE.

Pursuant to the exception granted to foreign private issuers under Section&#160;303A.00 of the NYSE Listed Company Manual, we have elected to follow our home country practice with respect to our board of directors. Currently, we have six directors on our board, consisting of three independent directors and three directors who are or had been our executive officers or employed by us. Nevertheless, we have maintained fully independent audit, compensation and nominating and corporate governance committees on our board of directors since the first anniversary of our NYSE listing. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Section&#160;303A.08 of the NYSE Listed Company Manual requires a listed company to obtain its shareholders&#8217; approval of all equity-compensation plans, and any material revisions to the terms of such plans. Under Cayman Islands law, we are not required to obtain shareholders&#8217; approval for adoption of new equity-compensation plans or amendments to our existing equity incentive plan. Our board adopted our 2016 share incentive plan in January 2016. We have followed the home country practice and did not obtain shareholder approval for adopting the 2016 share incentive plan. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Other than the requirements discussed above, there are no significant differences between our corporate governance practices and those followed by domestic listed companies as required under the NYSE Listed Company Manual.

The Company&#8217;s offshore holding companies are not educational institutions and do not provide educational services outside of China. In addition, in the PRC, foreign ownership of high schools for students in grades ten to twelve is restricted and foreign ownership of primary and middle schools for students in grades one to nine is prohibited. Accordingly, the Company&#8217;s offshore holding companies are not allowed to directly own and operate schools in China. The Company conducts substantially all of its education business in China through contractual arrangements with the consolidated VIEs, New Oriental China and its subsidiaries and schools and Xuncheng and its subsidiaries. Since the education business operations of New Oriental China and its subsidiaries and schools and Xuncheng and its subsidiaries are closely interrelated and almost indistinguishable from one another, the risks and rewards associated with their operations are substantially the same. In addition, the Company consolidates New Oriental China, its subsidiaries and schools, Xuncheng and its subsidiaries as disclosed. Therefore, the Company aggregates the disclosures related to New Oriental China, its subsidiaries and schools, and Xuncheng and its subsidiaries as the VIEs in the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements. The VIEs hold the requisite licenses and permits necessary to conduct the Company&#8217;s education business and <div style="white-space: nowrap; letter-spacing: 0px; top: 0px;display:inline;">e-commerce</div> business. In addition, the VIEs hold leases and other assets necessary to operate the Company&#8217;s schools and learning centers, employ teachers and generate substantially all of the Company&#8217;s revenues of education businesses. </div> <div style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:bold">VIE Arrangements between New Oriental China and the Company&#8217;s PRC subsidiaries </div> <div style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries in China (the &#8220;WFOEs&#8221;) entered into the following contractual arrangements with New Oriental China, New Oriental China&#8217;s subsidiaries and schools and New Oriental China&#8217;s shareholders that enable the Company to (1)&#160;have power to direct the activities that most significantly affects the economic performance of the VIEs, (2)&#160;receive substantially all of the economic benefits of the VIEs that could be significant to the VIEs and (3)&#160;have an exclusive option to purchase all or part of the equity interests in New Oriental China, when and to the extent permitted by the PRC law, or request the existing shareholder of New Oriental China to transfer all or part of the equity interest in New Oriental China to another PRC person or entity designated by the Company at any time in the Company&#8217;s discretion. Accordingly, the Company is considered the primary beneficiary of the VIE and has consolidated the VIE&#8217;s financial results of operations, assets and liabilities in the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements. In making the conclusion that the Company is the primary beneficiary of the VIE, the Company believes the Company&#8217;s rights under the terms of the exclusive option agreement provide it with the substantive <div style="white-space: nowrap; letter-spacing: 0px; top: 0px;display:inline;">kick-out</div> rights. More specifically, the Company believes the terms of the exclusive option agreement are valid, binding and enforceable under the PRC laws and regulations currently in effect. The Company also believes that the minimum amount of consideration permitted by the applicable PRC law to exercise the option does not represent a financial barrier or disincentive for the Company to currently exercise its rights under the exclusive option agreement. </div> <div style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">A simple majority vote of the Company&#8217;s board of directors is required to pass a resolution to exercise the Company&#8217;s rights under the exclusive option agreement, for which Mr.&#160;Michael Minhong Yu (&#8220;Mr.&#160;Yu&#8221;)&#8217;s consent is not required. The Company&#8217;s rights under the exclusive option agreement give the Company the power to control the shareholders of New Oriental China and thus the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the schools&#8217; economic performance given that New Oriental China has the power to direct the activities of the schools via its sponsorship interest. In addition, the Company&#8217;s rights under the power of attorney also reinforce the Company&#8217;s abilities to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE&#8217;s economic performance. The Company also believes that this ability to exercise control ensures that the VIE will continue to execute and renew service agreements and pay service fees to the Company. By charging service fees in whatever amounts the Company deems fit, and by ensuring that service agreements are executed and renewed indefinitely, the Company has the rights to receive substantially all of the economic benefits from the VIE. </div> <div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 8pt;">&#160;</div> <div style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman;text-align:center"><ix:exclude>F-1<div style="letter-spacing: 0px; top: 0px;display:inline;">7</div></ix:exclude> </div></ix:continuation> </div> </div> <ix:continuation id="TextSelectionAppend_147498979_8" continuedAt="TextSelectionAppend_147498979_9"><ix:exclude><div style="margin-top:1em; margin-bottom:0em; page-break-before:always"></div></ix:exclude></ix:continuation> <ix:continuation id="TextSelectionAppend_147498979_9" continuedAt="TextSelectionAppend_147498979_10"><ix:exclude><hr style="color:#999999;height:3px;width:100%;clear:both"/></ix:exclude></ix:continuation><ix:continuation id="TextSelectionAppend_147498979_10" continuedAt="TextSelectionAppend_147498979_11"><ix:exclude> <div style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 1.67em; margin-bottom: 1.67em;font-weight: bold;"><div style="font-weight:bolder;display:inline;"><a href="#toc">Table of Contents</a></div></div> </ix:exclude></ix:continuation></div> </div> <div> <div> <div style="line-height:normal;display: inline;"> <div style="text-align:center"> <div style="width:8.5in;text-align:left;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto"> <ix:continuation id="TextSelectionAppend_147498979_11" continuedAt="TextSelectionAppend_147498979_12"><div style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><div style="letter-spacing: 0px; top: 0px;display:inline;"><div style="font-weight:bolder;display:inline;"><div style="font-style:italic;display:inline;">Service agreements. </div></div></div>There are four types of service agreements: (i)&#160;trademark license agreements, (ii)&#160;new enrollment system development service agreements, (iii)&#160;other operating service agreements, and (iv)&#160;sale of educational software agreements. </div> <div style="font-size:6pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">&#160;</div>

Recent transactions include the purchase price agreed by an independent third party for a similar investment and have been classified as Level 2 measurement. When no recent transactions are available, the Company has classified those as Level 3 measurement and a market approach or income approach will be used by the Company to measure fair value. The market approach takes into consideration a number of factors including market multiple and discount rates from traded companies in the industry and requires the Company to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding industry factors. The income approach takes into consideration a number of factors including management projection of discounted future cash flow of the investee as well as an appropriate discount rate. The assumptions are inherently uncertain and subjective. Specifically, some of the significant unobservable inputs included the expected volatility, discount rate as well as discount of lack of marketability. Changes in any unobservable inputs may have a significant impact on fair values. As of May 31, 2025, the fair values of available-for-sale investments classified as Level 3 were measured using the market or income approaches with significant unobservable inputs were based on the following assumptions: (1) expected volatility ranging from</div> <ix:nonFraction name="us-gaap:DebtSecuritiesAvailableForSaleMeasurementInput" contextRef="PAsOn05_31_2025_FairValueInputsLevel3MemberusgaapFairValueByFairValueHierarchyLevelAxis_MeasurementInputPriceVolatilityMemberusgaapMeasurementInputTypeAxis_MinimumMembersrtRangeAxis" unitRef="Unit_pure" decimals="1" scale="0" format="ixt:num-dot-decimal" id="ixv-38670">33.0</ix:nonFraction><div style="text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: 0px; top: 0px;display:inline;">%</div>&#160;to <ix:nonFraction name="us-gaap:DebtSecuritiesAvailableForSaleMeasurementInput" contextRef="PAsOn05_31_2025_FairValueInputsLevel3MemberusgaapFairValueByFairValueHierarchyLevelAxis_MaximumMembersrtRangeAxis_MeasurementInputPriceVolatilityMemberusgaapMeasurementInputTypeAxis" unitRef="Unit_pure" decimals="1" scale="0" format="ixt:num-dot-decimal" id="ixv-38671">93.7</ix:nonFraction><div style="text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: 0px; top: 0px;display:inline;">%</div>, <div style="text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: 0px; top: 0px;display:inline;">(2) discount rate</div> <ix:nonFraction name="us-gaap:DebtSecuritiesAvailableForSaleMeasurementInput" contextRef="PAsOn05_31_2025_FairValueInputsLevel3MemberusgaapFairValueByFairValueHierarchyLevelAxis_MeasurementInputDiscountRateMemberusgaapMeasurementInputTypeAxis" unitRef="Unit_pure" decimals="0" scale="0" format="ixt:num-dot-decimal" id="ixv-38672">21</ix:nonFraction><div style="text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: 0px; top: 0px;display:inline;">%</div>,<div style="letter-spacing: 0px; top: 0px;display:inline;">&#160;</div><div style="text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: 0px; top: 0px;display:inline;">and (3) discount of lack of marketability ranging from</div> <ix:nonFraction name="us-gaap:DebtSecuritiesAvailableForSaleMeasurementInput" contextRef="PAsOn05_31_2025_FairValueInputsLevel3MemberusgaapFairValueByFairValueHierarchyLevelAxis_MeasurementInputDiscountRateMemberusgaapMeasurementInputTypeAxis_MinimumMembersrtRangeAxis" unitRef="Unit_pure" decimals="1" scale="0" format="ixt:num-dot-decimal" id="ixv-38673">15.0</ix:nonFraction><div style="letter-spacing: 0px; top: 0px;display:inline;">%</div>&#160;<div style="letter-spacing: 0px; top: 0px;display:inline;">to <ix:nonFraction name="us-gaap:DebtSecuritiesAvailableForSaleMeasurementInput" contextRef="PAsOn05_31_2025_FairValueInputsLevel3MemberusgaapFairValueByFairValueHierarchyLevelAxis_MaximumMembersrtRangeAxis_MeasurementInputDiscountRateMemberusgaapMeasurementInputTypeAxis" unitRef="Unit_pure" decimals="1" scale="0" format="ixt:num-dot-decimal" id="ixv-38674">25.0</ix:nonFraction>%.</div></div><div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 8pt;text-indent: 0px;">&#160;</div><div style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman;text-align:center;text-indent: 0px;"><ix:exclude>F-4<div style="letter-spacing: 0px; top: 0px;display:inline;">3</div></ix:exclude> </div></ix:continuation></div></div><ix:continuation id="TextSelectionAppend_147499037_4" continuedAt="TextSelectionAppend_147499037_5"><ix:exclude><div style="margin-top:1em; margin-bottom:0em; page-break-before:always"></div></ix:exclude></ix:continuation><ix:continuation id="TextSelectionAppend_147499037_5" continuedAt="TextSelectionAppend_147499037_6"><ix:exclude><hr style="color:#999999;height:3px;width:100%;clear:both"/></ix:exclude></ix:continuation><ix:continuation id="TextSelectionAppend_147499037_6" continuedAt="TextSelectionAppend_147499037_7"><ix:exclude> <div style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 1.67em; margin-bottom: 1.67em;font-weight: bold;"><div style="font-weight:bolder;display:inline;"><a href="#toc">Table of Contents</a></div></div></ix:exclude></ix:continuation></div></div></div> <div><div><div style="line-height:normal;display: inline;"><div style="text-align:center"><div style="width:8.5in;text-align:left;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto"><ix:continuation id="TextSelectionAppend_147499037_7"><div style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Group had transfers between Level 2 and Level 3 during the year ended May 31, 2024.
